      <p class="subtitle">
        In 2026, criminals can still hijack your mail with a fraudulent USPS change-of-address (COA)

        they can intercept bank cards, checks and identity documents. This guide shows you exactly
        how to spot COA fraud early, how to cancel a fraudulent forwarding order, how to restore
        your correct address, and what to do next to protect your identity and credit.

      <h2>1. How USPS change-of-address fraud works in 2026</h2>
      <p>
        Change-of-address fraud happens when someone submits a USPS COA request in your name,
        redirecting your mail to a different address controlled by them. They do this to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>intercept debit and credit cards,</li>
        <li>steal checks and bank statements,</li>
        <li>collect identity information to open new accounts,</li>
        <li>hide important letters (collection notices, legal mail, etc.) from you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A COA request can be submitted:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>online via the USPS website (with a small card verification charge),</li>
        <li>using a physical PS Form 3575 in a post office or mailbox.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In practice, criminals use stolen or guessed data plus mail access to pass basic checks.  
        Your job is to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>detect the fraud quickly,</li>
        <li>cancel the forwarding order,</li>
        <li>repair the damage and lock your identity.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section id="section-2" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>2. Warning signs your mail is being forwarded without consent</h2>
      <p>Watch for these red flags in 2026:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You suddenly stop receiving important mail (bank, IRS, insurance, utility bills).</li>
        <li>Neighbors say they see a different mail carrier pattern or your mailbox is always empty.</li>
        <li>You get an unexpected USPS “Change-of-Address Confirmation” letter (or you never receive it at all).</li>
        <li>Your bank or card issuer says “statements were returned” or “address changed” without your request.</li>
        <li>You see new accounts on your credit report that you didn’t open.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even if you are not 100% sure, treat missing mail as serious.  
        It is easier to cancel a legitimate COA you forgot about than to ignore real fraud.

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <section id="section-3" class="section container">
      <h2>3. Step 1 – Confirm if a change-of-address order exists</h2>
      <p>
        Before you can fix the problem, you need to confirm whether USPS actually has a COA
        order on file – and whether it’s temporary or permanent, individual or entire household.
      </p>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>3.1 Contact USPS immediately</h3>
          <p>
            Go to your local post office with a government ID and proof of address (utility bill, lease, etc.)  
            Tell the clerk:
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            “I believe someone may have filed a fraudulent change-of-address for me.  
            Can you check whether there is any active forwarding order on my name and address?”
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>3.2 Ask for key details</h3>
          <p>Ask USPS staff to confirm:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>whether a COA exists,</li>
            <li>its type (individual or family / household),</li>
            <li>start date,</li>
            <li>the forwarding address (they may not show full details, but ask what they can disclose),</li>
            <li>whether it was submitted online or on paper.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>3.3 Keep a record</h3>
          <p>
            Write down the date, post office location and name of the employee you spoke with.  
            You may need this if you file complaints or police reports later.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <section id="section-4" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>4. Step 2 – Cancel the fraudulent COA and restore your address</h2>
      <p>
        Once you know a fraudulent forwarding order exists, your priority is to cancel it and
        restore mail delivery to your true address.
      </p>

      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>4.1 Request immediate cancellation at the post office</h3>
          <p>
            At the counter, ask the clerk to <strong>cancel the COA order immediately</strong> and restore regular delivery
            to your original address. Show:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>government-issued photo ID,</li>
            <li>proof of residence (utility bill, lease, mortgage statement, etc.).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If they require forms, fill them out on the spot.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>4.2 Submit a written fraud statement if needed</h3>
          <p>
            Some post offices or USPS investigators may ask for a written statement that you did not
            authorize the COA. In your letter, include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>your full name and address,</li>
            <li>a statement that you did not request or authorize any COA,</li>
            <li>dates when you noticed missing mail,</li>
            <li>your signature and contact information.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>4.3 Ask USPS to hold mail temporarily (optional)</h3>
          <p>
            If the situation is messy and you want to make sure no mail is misrouted while they fix
            records, request a short-term <strong>USPS Hold Mail</strong> while the fraudulent COA is being canceled.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>4.4 Monitor your mailbox closely</h3>
          <p>
            Over the next 1–2 weeks, check that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>mail starts arriving again,</li>
            <li>no new USPS COA confirmation letters appear,</li>
            <li>no bank or service provider says your address has changed again.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <h2>5. Step 3 – Protect bank accounts, cards and checks</h2>
      <p>
        If someone intercepted your mail, treat it as a direct threat to your financial accounts.
        Do not wait for fraud to appear – act as if they already have your information.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Call your banks and card issuers:</strong>  
          Tell them there was USPS mail theft / forwarding fraud affecting your address and ask them to:
          <ul>
            <li>monitor for unusual transactions,</li>
            <li>cancel and reissue cards if necessary,</li>
            <li>send replacements only after your address is corrected.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stop payment on checks:</strong>  
          If checkbooks or mailed checks may have been intercepted, ask your bank to stop payment on
          those check ranges and issue new ones.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Review recent statements:</strong>  
          Look for small “test” charges that could indicate someone is checking if cards are active.

      <h2>6. Step 4 – Lock down your credit and identity</h2>
      <p>
        USPS COA fraud is often just the first step in identity theft. Use credit protections to cut
        off the next moves.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Place a fraud alert or credit freeze:</strong>  
          Contact the major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) to add a fraud alert or
          freeze so new credit can’t be opened in your name without extra checks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Check your credit reports:</strong>  
          Pull your reports and look for:
          <ul>
            <li>new accounts you did not open,</li>
            <li>address changes you didn’t authorize,</li>
            <li>hard inquiries from lenders you don’t recognize.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Update key accounts with the correct address:</strong>  
          Make sure your bank, employer, tax authority and insurers all have your real address to
          avoid more misdirected mail.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consider filing an identity theft report:</strong>  
          If you see concrete signs of identity theft (new credit, fraudulent charges), file an
          identity theft report with the appropriate U.S. agency and your local police as directed.

      <h2>7. How to prevent USPS change-of-address fraud in the future</h2>
      <p>Once your address is clean again, use these habits to reduce risk:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Check your mailbox consistently:</strong>  
          Don’t let mail pile up; an always-full or always-empty mailbox is a fraud signal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use online accounts:</strong>  
          Switch important statements (banks, cards, utilities) to online delivery where possible,
          with strong login security.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shred sensitive mail:</strong>  
          Destroy old statements, pre-approved offers and any mail with your personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consider PO Box or locked mailbox:</strong>  
          For high-risk locations, using a PO Box or secure mailbox can dramatically reduce mail theft.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Watch for unexpected USPS notices:</strong>  
          Treat any “change-of-address confirmation” you don’t recognize as an emergency signal.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You cannot control every USPS process, but you can make your address a much harder target.

      <h2>USPS change-of-address fraud 2026 – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can someone really change my address without my signature?</h3>
        <p>
          In practice, yes. While USPS has safeguards, criminals can still abuse COA processes using
          partial personal data and access to mail. That’s why you must react quickly to any sign of
          mail forwarding you didn’t request.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will USPS tell me who changed my address?</h3>
        <p>
          USPS may not reveal full details about who submitted the request, especially if there is an
          active investigation. However, they should confirm whether a COA exists and help you cancel it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I get my stolen mail back?</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes misdirected mail can be recovered if it was not yet delivered or is still in transit,
          but often it is impossible to retrieve. Focus on stopping the forwarding and protecting your
          accounts going forward.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is USPS change-of-address fraud the same as identity theft?</h3>
        <p>
          COA fraud is often a gateway to identity theft because it lets criminals intercept sensitive
          information. Even if you don’t see fraudulent accounts yet, treat it as a high-risk event and
          use credit protections.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need a lawyer to deal with USPS COA fraud?</h3>
        <p>
          Most cases can be handled directly with USPS, your bank and the credit bureaus using the steps
          in this guide. If large financial losses or complex identity theft are involved, legal advice
          may be helpful.
