  <h2 id="section1">1. What is the DOT Airline Compensation Deregulation for 2026?</h2>
  <p>
    The new DOT airline compensation rules for 2026 eliminate the previous cap on compensation for delays, cancellations, and
    denied boarding. Airlines are now required to compensate passengers based on the length of the delay and the price of the ticket.
    Compensation can include things like hotel accommodation, meals, and even full refunds for long delays or cancellations.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section2">2. How much compensation can I get for delays and cancellations?</h2>
  <p>
    Compensation for delays and cancellations is determined based on several factors, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The length of the delay (typically over 2-3 hours depending on the flight).</li>
    <li>The type of flight (domestic vs. international).</li>
    <li>The ticket price and class of service.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Passengers may receive compensation in the form of meal vouchers, hotel stays, or even a full refund, depending on the specific
    circumstances and the airline’s policy.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section3">3. How to file for compensation after a delayed or cancelled flight?</h2>
  <p>
    You should file for compensation directly with the airline’s customer service either at the airport or through their online
    platform. Provide the flight details, including the delay duration and reason for cancellation, and make sure to keep all receipts
    and documents related to additional expenses.
  </p>
