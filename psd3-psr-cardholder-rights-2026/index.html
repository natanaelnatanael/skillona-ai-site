      <h1>PSD3 & PSR Cardholder Rights 2026 – Refunds, Chargebacks & Fraud Protection in the EU</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        In late 2025 the EU agreed on a new Payment Services Regulation (PSR) and an updated Payment Services Directive
        (PSD3). As these rules start to apply from 2026 onwards, banks and payment providers will be more clearly
        liable for many types of fraud, must show all fees up front, and must give you better tools to block and
        control payments. This guide explains, in plain language, what that means for you as a cardholder or account
        holder in the EU.

      <h2>1. What PSD3 & PSR are – and when they start to matter for you</h2>
      <p>
        The EU’s new “payments package” has two main pieces that affect ordinary consumers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PSD3</strong> – an updated Payment Services Directive, dealing mainly with licensing and supervision of payment and e-money institutions.</li>
        <li><strong>PSR</strong> – a new Payment Services Regulation, with most of the everyday rules on fraud, transparency, fees and open banking. It applies directly across the EU once in force. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In November 2025, the European Parliament and Council reached a <strong>political agreement</strong> on the final PSR/PSD3 texts,
        including stronger fraud protection, mandatory name/IBAN checks, clearer fee information and better access to cash. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The usual sequence is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>late 2025 / 2026 – formal adoption and publication of the PSR and PSD3,</li>
        <li>a set application date for most PSR rules (often 12–18 months after entry into force),</li>
        <li>for PSD3, extra time for countries to write the directive into national law (transposition).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This guide calls it the <strong>“2026”</strong> package because that is roughly when consumers can expect to start
        feeling the effects, but some rights may apply a bit earlier or later depending on your country and bank.

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section id="section-2" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>2. New fraud & impersonation scam refunds – who pays what</h2>
      <p>
        Under the new rules, the basic idea is simple: <strong>if your bank or payment provider fails to use proper anti-fraud tools,
        it should pay for the loss, not you.</strong>
      </p>

      <div class="table-wrapper">
        <table class="code-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Scenario</th>
              <th>How it’s treated under PSR</th>
              <th>What it means for you</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Classic unauthorised transaction</strong><br>(fraudster initiates or changes payment)</td>
              <td>Treated as unauthorised. Provider is liable for the full amount, unless you acted fraudulently.</td>
              <td>Your account must be reimbursed; the bank cannot shift its own security failures onto you. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Impersonation scam</strong><br>(fraudster pretends to be bank or company employee)</td>
              <td>If you were tricked into approving a payment and you report it to the police and your provider, the provider must refund you in full, then may recover costs from platforms that helped spread the scam. </td>
              <td>You get a full reimbursement, as long as you report promptly and cooperate.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Provider ignored key fraud tools</strong><br>(no name/IBAN check, no flagging of obvious risk)</td>
              <td>If the provider does not properly implement required anti-fraud tools, it is liable for resulting losses.</td>
              <td>Even in “authorised” payments, your bank can be forced to absorb the loss if it failed to use the tools correctly. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Customer clearly negligent</strong><br>(sharing PIN, ignoring obvious warnings)</td>
              <td>As with earlier rules, very serious negligence or fraud by the user can still limit their protection.</td>
              <td>If you actively help the fraud or ignore multiple red flags, you may not be fully covered.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        A major new element is that <strong>big online platforms</strong> can become liable to pay banks back if they were warned
        about fraudulent content (fake ads, scam investment offers, etc.) and did nothing. This gives platforms a direct
        financial reason to remove scams quickly. 
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <section id="section-3" class="section container">
      <h2>3. Name/IBAN checks, spending limits & blocking tools</h2>
      <p>
        The PSR turns several “nice to have” features into <strong>legal obligations</strong> for payment service providers.
      </p>

      <h3>3.1 Mandatory name/IBAN checks (“confirmation of payee”)</h3>
      <p>
        Before many transfers, your provider will need to check whether the <strong>account name matches the IBAN</strong>.
        If there is a mismatch, they must:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>warn you clearly or reject the payment, and</li>
        <li>not go ahead silently when details obviously don’t fit. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This directly targets frauds where scammers give you an IBAN that looks like it belongs to a genuine company.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 User-controlled spending limits and blocking</h3>
      <p>
        Banks and providers must offer ways for you to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>set <strong>spending limits</strong> per card or payment method,</li>
        <li><strong>block</strong> certain types of payments (e.g. online, cross-border, contactless),</li>
        <li>temporarily <strong>freeze</strong> a card or account if something looks wrong. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On their side, receiving providers must be able to <strong>freeze suspicious incoming payments</strong>, to stop money
        disappearing to a scam account as soon as it arrives.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <section id="section-4" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>4. Refund rights vs “chargebacks” – how they fit together</h2>
      <p>
        There are two big concepts that get mixed up:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal refund rights</strong> under EU payments law (PSR / PSD2 / PSD3).</li>
        <li><strong>Card scheme chargebacks</strong> (Visa, Mastercard rules) – a private system between banks and card schemes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.1 Legal refund rights</h3>
      <p>
        These include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>refunds for <strong>unauthorised transactions</strong> (including many frauds),</li>
        <li>refunds in some direct debit and merchant-initiated transaction (MIT) cases,</li>
        <li>under PSR, stronger protection where the provider has failed to apply the required anti-fraud tools. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These rights come from law, not from Visa/Mastercard. Your provider cannot contract them away in its small print.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Chargebacks</h3>
      <p>
        Chargebacks are separate:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>They are <strong>card scheme rules</strong>, not EU law.</li>
        <li>They cover disputes like “goods not received” or “service not as described”, as well as some fraud scenarios.</li>
        <li>They have strict time limits and evidence requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Under PSR, the legal baseline becomes stronger. Banks can still use chargebacks internally to recover money from
        merchants or other banks, but your <strong>minimum protection</strong> against fraud and some wrong payments comes from the
        regulation itself.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <section id="section-5" class="section container">
      <h2>5. Fees, ATM withdrawals & hidden currency conversion charges</h2>
      <p>
        A big goal of the PSR deal is to <strong>eliminate surprises on fees</strong> and “junk” exchange rates. </p>

      <h3>5.1 ATM transparency and access to cash</h3>
      <p>
        Under the new rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>ATM providers must clearly show <strong>all fees and exchange rates</strong> before you confirm a withdrawal.</li>
        <li>Retailers will be allowed to offer <strong>cash withdrawals without a purchase</strong>, up to a limit (often around €150), using chip & PIN to prevent abuse. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is designed to protect cash access in rural or under-served areas while stopping ATM operators from hiding fees at the last step.
      </p>

      <h3>5.2 Currency conversion and “hidden” margins</h3>
      <p>
        Providers will have to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>show the <strong>exchange rate and their margin</strong> before a cross-currency payment or withdrawal,</li>
        <li>avoid dark patterns that steer you into “dynamic currency conversion” at poor rates.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You should always be able to see the true cost and compare “pay in local currency” vs “pay in your home currency” before deciding.
      </p>

      <h3>5.3 Merchant name clarity on statements</h3>
      <p>
        Merchants must ensure that the trading name you see on your bank statement matches the name you recognise
        from the shop or website. This reduces “mystery charges” that are actually legitimate but badly labelled. 
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <section id="section-6" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>6. Open banking, data permissions & human customer support</h2>
      <p>
        The PSR and PSD3 also touch on how your data and customer service work in practice.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Open banking & dashboards:</strong> banks must offer tools so you can see and manage which third-party apps
          have access to your accounts, and remove permissions easily. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-discriminatory access:</strong> authorised payment and data-access providers should get fair, secure access
          to your account data, encouraging competition and better services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Human support:</strong> banks cannot rely on chatbots only – you must be able to reach <strong>human customer support</strong>,
          especially in fraud and dispute situations. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For you, this should mean fewer dead-ends when something goes wrong and more control over which apps see your financial data.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 7 -->
    <section id="section-7" class="section container">
      <h2>7. Step-by-step: What to do when something goes wrong</h2>
      <p>
        Use this simple sequence whenever you see a suspicious or wrong payment from 2026 onward.
      </p>

      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Step 1 – Freeze first, investigate second</h3>
          <p>
            Use your banking app or call your provider to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>block the card or payment method,</li>
            <li>set spending limits to zero if possible,</li>
            <li>ask the provider to freeze any suspicious outgoing or incoming transfers.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 2 – Report the transaction as unauthorised or disputed</h3>
          <p>
            Make it clear which case you think applies:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>unauthorised/fraud</strong> – you did not initiate it, or details were changed,</li>
            <li><strong>impersonation scam</strong> – you were tricked by someone posing as the bank or another company,</li>
            <li><strong>other dispute</strong> – goods/services issues that might use card chargeback rules.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 3 – File a police report if it looks like a scam</h3>
          <p>
            For impersonation scams, PSR refunds generally require that you:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>report the fraud to the police, and</li>
            <li>inform your provider promptly and share the reference number. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 4 – Ask explicitly which legal right they are applying</h3>
          <p>
            When the bank responds, ask them to state:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>whether they treat the payment as unauthorised or not,</li>
            <li>whether they believe they met all PSR anti-fraud obligations (name/IBAN check, SCA, etc.),</li>
            <li>which legal basis they rely on to refuse or grant a refund.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This makes it easier to escalate to a national ombudsman or regulator if needed.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 5 – Escalate if you disagree</h3>
          <p>
            If you are not satisfied:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>use the bank’s internal complaint procedure,</li>
            <li>then escalate to your national financial ombudsman or supervisor if available,</li>
            <li>keep all written responses and timelines – PSR expects providers to handle complaints within clear deadlines.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>8. Checklist: How to use your stronger rights from 2026 onwards</h2>
      <p>
        Quick actions to take once your bank implements PSR/PSD3 changes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Turn on and customise <strong>spending limits</strong> and <strong>blocks</strong> for cards and online payments.</li>
        <li>Check if your bank offers <strong>name/IBAN match warnings</strong> – and pay attention to them.</li>
        <li>Review your <strong>open banking dashboard</strong> and revoke access for apps you no longer use.</li>
        <li>Get familiar with the <strong>fraud reporting</strong> section of your app or online banking.</li>
        <li>Keep screenshots and confirmations when you are warned about risks but proceed anyway – this can matter later.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The combination of stronger legal rules and better tools only works if you actually use them.

      <h2>PSD3 & PSR cardholder rights – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>From which year will these new rights actually apply?</h3>
        <p>
          The political agreement on PSR/PSD3 was reached in November 2025. After formal adoption, there will
          be a delay before most rules apply (often 12–18 months for a regulation). In practice, many consumers
          will start to feel the changes from <strong>2026–2027</strong>, depending on their country and provider.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do these rules apply if I bank with a non-EU fintech?</h3>
        <p>
          If you are an EU resident and the provider is authorised to offer services in the EU (directly or via
          passporting), PSR rules should still apply to those services. Details can vary, so check your provider’s
          terms and your national regulator’s guidance.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will my bank always refund me for scams?</h3>
        <p>
          No system is absolute. PSR greatly improves protection, especially where the bank failed to apply required
          tools or where you were the victim of impersonation fraud and reported it correctly. But deliberate misuse
          or very serious negligence by the customer can still limit protection.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is a card chargeback the same as a PSR refund?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Chargebacks are scheme rules (Visa/Mastercard) that banks use between themselves. PSR refunds come from
          EU law and set your <strong>minimum</strong> rights. In many cases banks use both – legal rules for the customer
          and chargebacks to recover money from merchants or other banks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this guide official EU or legal advice?</h3>

In practice, many consumers will start to feel the changes from 2026\u20132027, depending on their country and provider."

          "text": "No system is absolute. PSR greatly improves protection, especially where the bank failed to apply required tools or where you were the victim of impersonation fraud and reported it correctly. But deliberate misuse or very serious negligence by the customer can still limit protection."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "No. Chargebacks are scheme rules (Visa/Mastercard) that banks use between themselves. PSR refunds come from EU law and set your minimum rights. In many cases banks use both \u2013 legal rules for the customer and chargebacks to recover money from merchants or other banks."
