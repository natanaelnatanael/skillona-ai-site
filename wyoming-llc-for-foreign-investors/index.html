        <h2>1. Why Wyoming LLC for Foreign Investors?</h2>
        <p>
          Wyoming has become one of the most popular US states for holding companies and real estate
          structures because it offers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No state income tax</li>
          <li>Strong asset protection laws</li>
          <li>Privacy (members do not have to be listed on public records)</li>
          <li>Low annual fees and simple maintenance</li>
          <li>Fast and fully online registration through a registered agent</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box">
          <div class="box-title">Core idea</div>
          <p>
            A Wyoming LLC can hold US rental properties, receive rent, sign loans and contracts, and
            separate your personal assets from US liabilities.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Basic Structure for a Foreign Investor</h2>
        <p>Typical setup for a non-US investor looks like this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>You</strong> (individual, foreign resident)</li>
          <li>↓ owner / member</li>
          <li><strong>Wyoming LLC</strong> (holding or operating company)</li>
          <li>↓ owner</li>
          <li><strong>US property</strong> (single-family, multifamily, condo, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In some cases investors use:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>One Wyoming LLC as a <strong>holding company</strong></li>
          <li>Separate LLCs (in property states) as <strong>title-holding entities</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box box-warning">
          <div class="box-title">Tax note</div>
          <p>
            A Wyoming LLC does not eliminate US tax on rental income or capital gains. It is mainly
            an asset protection and structuring tool. US and home-country taxation must be coordinated.
          </p>
        </div>

      <section id="steps">
        <h2>3. Step-by-Step: Forming a Wyoming LLC as a Non-US Resident</h2>

        <h3>Step 1 – Choose a name</h3>
        <p>
          The LLC name must be unique in Wyoming and include “LLC” or similar. Avoid trademarks.
          Many registered agents provide free name search tools.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2 – Select a registered agent in Wyoming</h3>
        <p>
          Wyoming law requires a registered agent with a physical address in the state to receive
          legal documents. For foreign investors this is always a professional agent service.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3 – File Articles of Organization</h3>
        <p>
          Your registered agent usually files the Articles online with the Wyoming Secretary of State.
          You provide:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>LLC name</li>
          <li>Registered agent info</li>
          <li>Mailing address (can be foreign)</li>
          <li>Organizer information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After approval, you receive a filed copy and a Certificate of Organization.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4 – Prepare an Operating Agreement</h3>
        <p>
          The Operating Agreement is the internal contract that defines:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Who owns the LLC (members)</li>
          <li>Management structure (member-managed or manager-managed)</li>
          <li>Capital contributions</li>
          <li>Profit distribution</li>
          <li>Decision-making rules</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Banks and lenders often ask for this document. It does not have to be filed with the state.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 5 – Obtain an EIN (US tax ID for the LLC)</h3>
        <p>
          Even without a Social Security Number, a foreign-owned LLC can get an EIN from the IRS.
          There are two main routes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Online application (limited for foreign applicants, but sometimes possible)</li>
          <li>Fax or mail using Form SS-4, with “Foreign” box checked</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many registered agents or CPAs offer EIN application as an add-on service.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 6 – Open a US bank account (or fintech account)</h3>
        <p>
          With a filed LLC and EIN, you can open:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A traditional US bank account (often requires in-person visit), or</li>
          <li>A US-based fintech / online bank that supports foreign-owned LLCs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Requirements vary; some institutions accept:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Passport</li>
          <li>Proof of address (can be foreign)</li>
          <li>LLC documents (Articles, Operating Agreement, EIN letter)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Using the Wyoming LLC to Buy US Property</h2>
        <p>
          Once the LLC and bank account are ready, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sign purchase contracts in the LLC’s name</li>
          <li>Take title to the property as “XYZ LLC”</li>
          <li>Receive rent directly into the LLC bank account</li>
          <li>Sign loan documents (if a lender accepts the structure)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some lenders prefer the property to be in an LLC formed in the same state as the property.
          In that case, your Wyoming LLC can own a local LLC (for example, in Florida or Texas).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Annual Maintenance and Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          Wyoming maintenance is relatively simple:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Annual report filed with the Secretary of State</li>
          <li>Annual fee (often based on assets located in Wyoming)</li>
          <li>Registered agent renewal fee</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition, a foreign-owned LLC with US income may have:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>US federal tax filings</li>
          <li>Possible state-level filings where the property is located</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box box-warning">
          <div class="box-title">Important</div>
          <p>
            Asset protection only works if you respect the LLC as a separate entity:
            keep separate bank accounts, avoid mixing personal and LLC funds, and sign
            documents in the name of the LLC.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Advantages and Limitations for Foreign Investors</h2>
        <h3>Key advantages</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Separation of US liability from personal assets</li>
          <li>Potential anonymity in public records</li>
          <li>No Wyoming state income tax</li>
          <li>Flexible ownership structure (single or multiple members)</li>
          <li>Simple and cheap annual compliance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limitations and risks</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>US tax obligations still exist (federal and possibly state)</li>
          <li>Banking can be more complex for non-residents</li>
          <li>Some lenders may restrict lending to foreign-owned LLCs</li>
          <li>Needs coordination with your home country tax rules</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. FAQ – Short Answers</h2>

        <h3>Do I need to visit the US to form a Wyoming LLC?</h3>
        <p>
          No. You can form the LLC remotely through a registered agent. For banking, some institutions
          may require an in-person visit, others can be opened remotely.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I be the only owner (single-member LLC)?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Single-member LLCs are common for foreign investors. Tax treatment depends on your
          specific situation and elections.
        </p>

        <h3>Can the LLC own multiple properties in different states?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, but you may need to register the LLC as a “foreign LLC” in those states, or create
          separate property LLCs owned by the Wyoming holding company.
        </p>

        <h3>Does a Wyoming LLC help with US visas?</h3>
        <p>
          Having an LLC alone does not grant any visa status. Certain investment levels or business
          activity may support specific visa categories, but that is a separate immigration question.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need a US tax advisor?</h3>
        <p>
