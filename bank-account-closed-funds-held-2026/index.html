  <section id="section-1" class="section container">
    <h2>1. Why banks close accounts & hold funds in 2026</h2>
    <p>
      The top triggers in 2026:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anti-money-laundering flags (AML)</strong> triggered by transaction patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>Unusual deposits or withdrawals</strong> compared to your normal activity.</li>
      <li><strong>Zelle or ACH disputes</strong> leading to bank-initiated account shutdown.</li>
      <li><strong>High-risk merchant activity</strong> or frequent chargebacks.</li>
      <li><strong>Crypto on/off-ramp activity</strong> without proper documentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Mixed personal & business use</strong> on a personal checking account.</li>
      <li><strong>Suspicious check deposits</strong> even if legitimate.</li>
      <li><strong>KYC update failure</strong> — you didn’t submit documents when requested.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In nearly all cases, the bank holds your money during a “risk review.”  
      This review is almost always automated unless you push manually for escalation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 2 -->
  <section id="section-2" class="section section-alt container">
    <h2>2. How long banks can legally hold your money after closing the account</h2>
    <p>
      There is no single federal rule. But typical timelines in 2026 are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>10–30 days</strong> for low-risk closures.</li>
      <li><strong>30–60 days</strong> for fraud/AML reviews.</li>
      <li><strong>90–180 days</strong> for “suspicious” deposits (checks, ACH, crypto-related funds).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Banks do NOT have to give you details — but they DO have to release the funds when:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the review ends,</li>
      <li>there is no legal hold (courts, IRS, liens),</li>
      <li>no dispute is pending.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If they exceed reasonable review time, you can force movement (steps below).

    <h2>3. Step-by-step: How to get your money released</h2>

    <ol class="steps-list">
      <li>
        <h3>Step 1 – Call the bank’s risk/fraud operations (not customer service)</h3>
        <p>Customer service cannot help you. You need the risk team.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Step 2 – Request the “final review status”</h3>
        <p>Ask whether the review is pending, completed, or awaiting documents.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Step 3 – Provide any required documentation immediately</h3>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>proof of income,</li>
          <li>invoices for deposits,</li>
          <li>screenshots of transfers,</li>
          <li>crypto exchange statements,</li>
          <li>business registration documents.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Step 4 – Submit a written funds-release request</h3>
        <p>
          A written letter forces internal escalation. Templates included in the PDF pack.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Step 5 – File a CFPB or OCC complaint if nothing moves</h3>
        <p>
          This usually forces the bank to respond within 10–15 days.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Step 6 – Request cashier’s check or ACH to a new account</h3>
        <p>
          Once the review is complete, you can choose how to receive the funds.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. Scripts for calling the bank’s risk/fraud team</h2>

    <p class="note">
      “Hi, I received notice my account was closed and funds are being held.  
      I need the current status of the review and the exact documents required to release my balance.”
    </p>

    <p>Follow-up questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Is the review pending or completed?”</li>
      <li>“What specific items are delaying release?”</li>
      <li>“What is the expected release timeline based on your internal policy?”</li>
      <li>“Which department handles final approval?”</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 5 -->
  <section id="section-5" class="section container">
    <h2>5. Escalation path if the bank does not release your funds</h2>
    <p>
      If the bank is unresponsive or holding funds beyond a reasonable period, escalate:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>CFPB complaint</strong> – forces written response from the bank.</li>
      <li><strong>OCC complaint</strong> – for Chase, Wells Fargo, Citi, and national banks.</li>
      <li><strong>FDIC complaint</strong> – for state-chartered banks.</li>
      <li><strong>State financial regulator</strong> – effective for regional banks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You can also send a “letter of intent to litigate,” which often causes instant movement.
    </p>

  <!-- Section 6 -->
  <section id="section-6" class="section section-alt container">
    <h2>6. Special cases</h2>

    <h3>Zelle disputes</h3>
    <p>
      If Zelle flagged suspicious activity, banks often hold funds until all disputes are settled.
    </p>

    <h3>Crypto-related deposits</h3>
    <p>
      Banks may require proof of exchange accounts, wallet ownership, and source of funds.
    </p>

    <h3>ACH reversals</h3>
    <p>
      If you received an ACH later reversed by the sender’s bank, the bank may hold remaining funds until the investigation closes.
    </p>

    <h3>Check deposits</h3>
    <p>
      Suspicious or high-value checks can result in 30–180 day holds even after the account is closed.
