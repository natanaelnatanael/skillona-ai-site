      <h1>Eviction Sealed Record 2026 – How to Hide or Remove Evictions from Background Checks</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        An old eviction can block you from every decent apartment – even if you paid the debt, the case was
        dismissed, or it happened years ago. In 2026, more U.S. states allow eviction records to be sealed,
        expunged or hidden from public search. This guide explains how eviction records really work, when
        sealing is possible, and exactly what to file so tenant screening companies stop showing your case.

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <section id="section-1" class="section container">
      <h2>1. How eviction records and tenant screening work in 2026</h2>
      <p>
        In most of the U.S., an “eviction record” is simply a <strong>court case</strong> filed by a landlord
        against a tenant (for example, “unlawful detainer”, “forcible entry and detainer” or “summary
        eviction”). Even if you never got physically locked out, the filing can still show up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three main places eviction information lives:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Court docket:</strong> public record in the court’s system (online or at the courthouse).</li>
        <li><strong>Tenant screening databases:</strong> private companies that scrape court data and sell reports to landlords.</li>
        <li><strong>Credit reports:</strong> usually only if there was a money judgment sent to collections or reported by the landlord.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sealing or expunging an eviction usually means <strong>closing public access to the court case</strong>.
        After that, you must separately push tenant screening companies to update or delete their entries.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section id="section-2" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>2. When an eviction can be sealed, expunged or hidden</h2>
      <p>
        The exact rules are different in every state, but sealing is most often possible in situations like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The case was dismissed</strong> (landlord dropped it, you won, or you settled before judgment).</li>
        <li><strong>You won at trial</strong> or on appeal – judgment entered in your favor.</li>
        <li><strong>The judgment was satisfied</strong> – you paid and a period of time has passed.</li>
        <li><strong>Old cases</strong> – some states allow sealing after a set number of years.</li>
        <li><strong>Cases filed during special periods</strong> (for example, COVID-era protections in some places).</li>
        <li><strong>Clerical or identity errors</strong> – wrong person, wrong address, mistaken filing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some states automatically protect certain eviction records from being used in screening, while others
        require you to file a formal motion asking the judge to seal or restrict access to your case file.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <section id="section-3" class="section container">
      <h2>3. Step 1 – Get your court file & screening reports</h2>
      <p>
        Before you ask anyone to seal anything, you need to know exactly what’s on record and how it appears.
      </p>

      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>3.1 Find your eviction case in the court system</h3>
          <p>
            Search online with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>your full name (and previous names),</li>
            <li>the county and city where you rented,</li>
            <li>approximate filing year(s).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Note the exact <strong>case number</strong>, court name and the final outcome (dismissed, judgment, etc.).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>3.2 Get a copy of the docket and key documents</h3>
          <p>
            Download or request:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the docket sheet (timeline of filings),</li>
            <li>the final judgment or order,</li>
            <li>any stipulation or settlement agreement,</li>
            <li>any order that already mentions sealing or restricted access.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>3.3 Order or download your tenant screening reports</h3>
          <p>
            Ask the landlord or management company which screening services they use, and request copies of
            your reports from those companies. Also:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>pull your credit reports to check for collections or judgments,</li>
            <li>save all reports that mention eviction or “landlord-tenant” entries.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Keep everything in one folder – you’ll need it for your sealing motion and for disputes with
        screening companies later.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <section id="section-4" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>4. Step 2 – Check if you qualify under your state’s rules</h2>
      <p>
        Each state has its own language for eviction sealing, expungement or “limited access”. In general,
        you’re looking for rules that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>allow sealing after a <strong>dismissal</strong> or tenant victory,</li>
        <li>allow sealing after a <strong>waiting period</strong> if the judgment is paid or satisfied,</li>
        <li>allow sealing for <strong>older cases</strong> beyond a certain age,</li>
        <li>restrict use of certain types of eviction cases in screening decisions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Check:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>your state court’s self-help or forms website,</li>
        <li>legal aid or tenant rights websites in your state,</li>
        <li>local housing clinics, law school clinics or tenant hotlines.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your goal is to answer two questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>“Am I <strong>eligible</strong> under any of my state’s sealing or expungement options?”</li>
        <li>“Which <strong>form</strong> or motion do I need to file to ask the court to seal my case?”</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <section id="section-5" class="section container">
      <h2>5. Step 3 – File a motion or petition to seal the eviction</h2>
      <p>
        Once you know you’re eligible (or likely eligible), the next step is to ask the court formally.
      </p>

      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>5.1 Get the correct form or sample motion</h3>
          <p>
            Some courts have pre-made forms (“Motion to Seal Eviction”, “Petition to Restrict Access”).
            Others require you to file your own written motion using your state’s rules.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>5.2 Fill out your motion clearly and completely</h3>
          <p>Include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>case number, court name, landlord name and your name,</li>
            <li>date of the original case and outcome,</li>
            <li>which sealing law or rule you are asking the court to use,</li>
            <li>reasons why sealing is appropriate (dismissal, payment, age of case, hardship, etc.).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>5.3 Attach evidence</h3>
          <p>
            Attach:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>copy of the judgment or dismissal,</li>
            <li>proof of payment or satisfaction, if applicable,</li>
            <li>any documents showing errors or hardship (identity mistake, domestic violence, etc.).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>5.4 File with the clerk and serve the landlord</h3>
          <p>
            Follow your court’s rules for filing (online, in person or by mail) and for giving the landlord
            a copy of your motion. There may be a small filing fee or a fee waiver option.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>5.5 Attend the hearing (if the court schedules one)</h3>
          <p>
            Be ready to explain:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>what happened in the original case,</li>
            <li>why sealing is fair and allowed under your state’s law,</li>
            <li>how the eviction record is blocking your housing or job opportunities.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        If the judge grants your motion, the court will issue an order sealing or restricting access to the case.
        Make sure you get a copy of that order.

      <h2>6. Step 4 – Force tenant screening companies to update your record</h2>
      <p>
        Sealing the court record is powerful – but tenant screening companies may still show old data until
        you push them to update.
      </p>

      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>6.1 List every screening company that reported your eviction</h3>
          <p>
            Use your copies of rental screening reports to list:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>company names,</li>
            <li>report numbers,</li>
            <li>dates of reports.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>6.2 Send a dispute letter to each company</h3>
          <p>
            In your letter:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>identify yourself and your report number,</li>
            <li>state that the eviction case has been sealed or is inaccurate,</li>
            <li>attach the court order sealing the case or showing dismissal/tenant victory,</li>
            <li>ask them to delete or correct the eviction entry and send you an updated copy.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>6.3 Track responses and deadlines</h3>
          <p>
            Many consumer reporting laws require screening companies to investigate disputes within a set
            time and report results back to you.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>6.4 Dispute any related credit report entries</h3>
          <p>
            If a collection or judgment related to the eviction appears on your credit reports, dispute it
            separately with each credit bureau, attaching:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the sealing order (if it affects that entry), or</li>
            <li>proof of satisfaction or errors.</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>7. Step 5 – How to apply for rentals while your record is still visible</h2>
      <p>
        Sealing and corrections take time. While you’re waiting, you can still improve your chances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prepare a short written explanation</strong> of what happened and what changed since then.</li>
        <li><strong>Bring proof</strong> of stable income, good payment history with current landlord, and references.</li>
        <li><strong>Offer a slightly higher deposit</strong> or a co-signer if allowed and safe for you.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply with smaller landlords</strong> who review applications personally instead of strict automatic systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Show that the case was dismissed, satisfied or is being sealed</strong> with documentation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Landlords care about risk. If you can show that the eviction doesn’t reflect how you rent and pay now,
        some will look past it – especially if they see evidence of a sealing motion pending.

      <h2>Eviction sealed record 2026 – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can every eviction be sealed or expunged?</h3>
        <p>
          No. It depends on your state’s laws, the outcome of the case and how much time has passed. Dismissed
          cases and older, satisfied judgments are often the strongest candidates.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>If my eviction is sealed, will landlords still see it?</h3>
        <p>
          Sealing usually blocks public court access, but private screening databases may still show old data
          until you dispute it with them directly and they update their reports.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need a lawyer to seal an eviction?</h3>
        <p>
          Not always. Many tenants file their own motions using court forms or self-help guides. However,
          a housing attorney or legal aid office can help with complex cases or if the landlord objects.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does eviction sealing usually take?</h3>
        <p>
          It varies widely by court and state. Some courts decide motions in a few weeks; others take months,
          especially if a hearing is required or backlogs are large.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can sealing an eviction improve my credit score?</h3>
        <p>
          Sealing the court case itself doesn’t automatically change your credit. But if a related collection
          or judgment is removed or corrected, your credit reports and scores may improve over time.
