        <h2>1. Why Free Hearing Aids Matter</h2>
        <p>
          Around <strong>tens of millions of Americans</strong> live with some level of hearing loss, and a single
          pair of modern hearing aids can cost <strong>2,000–7,000 USD</strong> out of pocket.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Original Medicare generally does not cover routine hearing aids</strong> (some Medicare Advantage
          plans do), so low-income adults, seniors and children often need to rely on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>State <strong>Medicaid</strong> programs and children’s coverage</li>
          <li><strong>VA health care</strong> for eligible veterans</li>
          <li><strong>Assistive-technology and equipment programs</strong> (some funded under FCC or state grants)</li>
          <li>Nonprofit clinics and foundations</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box box-warning">
          <div class="box-title">Reality check</div>
          <p>
            Many people who qualify for <strong>free or heavily discounted hearing aids</strong> never apply simply
            because they do not know these programs exist or assume they “won’t qualify”.
            This guide is designed to help you understand the main paths and questions to ask.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Who Typically Qualifies?</h2>
        <p>Exact rules differ by program and state, but common categories include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Medicaid recipients</strong> – especially children and, in many states, adults who meet
            income and medical-necessity criteria.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Veterans enrolled in VA health care</strong>, particularly with documented hearing loss
            or service-connected conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Low-income households</strong> that qualify for communication and assistive-technology
            equipment programs in their state (sometimes funded through federal programs).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Children</strong> – hearing services for kids are more broadly covered under Medicaid’s
            Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit.
          </li>
          <li>
            In some places, <strong>people without citizenship or traditional insurance</strong> may still
            access certain state, county or nonprofit programs when medical need and income limits are met.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The PDF kit includes a checklist you can use with any clinic or social worker to quickly see
          which paths are worth trying first in your state.

        <h2>4. Medicaid – Step-by-Step (Many States, Especially for Children)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Check if your state covers hearing aids</strong> for your age group (adult vs child) –
            the PDF kit links directly to each state’s benefits page.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compare your income to the state limits</strong> – many use a percentage of the federal
            poverty level (FPL). The table below shows example 2025 figures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Apply online or via paper</strong> – links and QR codes by state are inside the kit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>After approval, choose a Medicaid-accepting audiologist</strong> – provider directories
            are linked in the kit and many states have search tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Schedule a hearing evaluation</strong> – the audiologist documents medical necessity
            and submits prior authorization if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fitting and follow-up</strong> – hearing aids are ordered and fitted once the plan approves.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          For children, EPSDT rules often make coverage broader and faster. For adults, coverage and limits
          differ a lot by state – some have strong benefits, others only partial.

      <section>
        <h2>5. VA Hearing Aids – Step-by-Step for Eligible Veterans</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Confirm VA eligibility</strong> – start at
            <a href="https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enroll in VA health care</strong> if you are not already enrolled.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ask for an audiology referral</strong> from your VA primary-care team or clinic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete a hearing evaluation</strong> – the VA audiologist will determine whether
            hearing aids are clinically appropriate based on your hearing loss and VA criteria.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device selection and fitting</strong> – the audiologist discusses which styles are
            suitable and orders devices covered by VA contracts.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          VA policies can offer very strong hearing benefits for veterans who qualify, but details depend on factors
          like your priority group, service connection and clinical findings.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Assistive-Technology & Equipment Programs</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to medical hearing aids, many states run <strong>assistive-technology (AT) programs</strong>
          and equipment distribution programs that can provide:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Amplified telephones and captioned phones</li>
          <li>Alerting systems (doorbells, smoke alarms, vibration devices)</li>
          <li>Certain listening accessories or communication devices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These programs are often funded by state agencies or federal initiatives (including FCC-funded
          projects for people with combined hearing and vision loss). They usually focus on
          <strong>communication access and safety</strong>, not purely cosmetic upgrades.
        </p>
        <div class="box">
          <div class="box-title">How to use them with hearing aids</div>
          <p>
            Even if the program does not pay for the hearing aids themselves, it can still provide extra
            devices that make everyday life much easier once you have aids (calls, alarms, TV listening, etc.).

        <h2>8. Example Income Limits 2025 (Medicaid & FCC-Style Programs)</h2>
        <p>
          Many programs use federal poverty level (FPL) percentages as a guide. The numbers below are
          example 2025 annual incomes for the 48 contiguous states. Your state or program may use slightly
          different thresholds or categories.

        <h2>10. FAQ – Short, Practical Answers</h2>

        <h3>How long does it take to get free or low-cost hearing aids?</h3>
        <p>
          Once your coverage is active and an audiologist has submitted all paperwork, many people receive
          devices in roughly <strong>1–3 weeks</strong>. Complex cases, busy clinics or missing documents
          can make it take longer.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I choose the brand?</h3>
        <p>
          Programs usually contract with several manufacturers (for example, well-known hearing-aid brands),
          but the exact choices depend on your audiogram, the clinic and the contract. You can often discuss
          style and features, but you may not be able to pick any brand on the open market.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I get two hearing aids?</h3>
        <p>
          Many programs cover <strong>bilateral</strong> devices when your audiologist documents that you
          have hearing loss in both ears and that two aids are medically appropriate. Coverage rules differ,
          so ask specifically about “one vs. two devices”.
        </p>

        <h3>Can undocumented immigrants ever qualify?</h3>
        <p>
          Rules vary a lot. Some states offer certain Medicaid or children’s benefits regardless of immigration
          status, and some nonprofit or assistive-technology programs focus on medical need and income instead
          of citizenship. You need to ask directly about local rules and what documentation they accept (for
          example, passport or ITIN).
        </p>

        <h3>Can I sell or give away the devices?</h3>
        <p>
          Generally no. Devices provided under Medicaid, VA or similar programs are intended for your medical use
          and may be subject to program rules. If they no longer work or are not needed, talk to your clinic about
          repair, replacement or proper return options.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I upgrade later?</h3>
        <p>
          Many programs allow <strong>replacement after a certain number of years</strong> or when your hearing
          changes. The exact schedule and upgrade policy are set by each plan or clinic. Ask your audiologist
          to note the replacement timeframe in writing.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need private insurance?</h3>
        <p>
          Not necessarily. Medicaid and VA are public coverage systems, and assistive-technology programs often
          use state or federal funds. Some programs have small copays; others are no-cost at the point of service
          if you qualify.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I apply on weekends?</h3>
        <p>
          Online benefit applications are usually available <strong>24/7</strong>, but audiology clinics and
          government offices typically operate on weekdays. You can still gather documents and submit forms
          online outside business hours.
        </p>

        <h3>Can children get free hearing aids?</h3>
        <p>
          Children often have <strong>stronger protections</strong> through Medicaid and children’s health
          programs. In many states, medically necessary pediatric hearing aids are fully covered – check the
          “children’s services” section for your state.
        </p>

        <h3>What if my application is denied?</h3>
        <p>
          Most programs have an <strong>appeal or fair-hearing process</strong>. The PDF kit includes sample
          letters you can adapt if you believe a denial was wrong or incomplete (for example, missing medical
          information or mis-understood income).
