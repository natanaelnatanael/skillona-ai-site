  <h2 id="section1">1. What is an IRS math error notice in 2026?</h2>
  <p>
    An IRS math error notice is a letter where the IRS changes your return automatically for what it treats as a
    “mathematical or clerical error” – without going through the normal audit and <em>notice of deficiency</em> process.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
  </p>
  <p>Common examples of “math error” issues include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic arithmetic mistakes and transposed numbers.</li>
    <li>Incorrect credits (for example, claiming a dependent twice or using the wrong child’s SSN).</li>
    <li>Missing or inconsistent information that the IRS can verify from its own records (for example, advance credits already paid).:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When the IRS issues a math error notice, it can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce or increase your refund, or</li>
    <li>Create a balance due immediately – <strong>unless</strong> you act within the 60-day window.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="section2">2. What changed under the IRS MATH Act?</h2>
  <p>
    In late 2025, Congress passed the <strong>Internal Revenue Service Math and Taxpayer Help Act (IRS MATH Act, H.R. 998)</strong>.
    The law was signed by the President on December 1, 2025 and is scheduled to take effect for math-error notices issued
    from late 2026.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
  </p>
  <p>Under the new law, math-error notices must now include all of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Plain-language description</strong> of the specific error.</li>
    <li>The <strong>exact line number</strong> (and schedule, if needed) that the IRS is changing.:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</li>
    <li>An <strong>itemized computation</strong> showing how the IRS changed your income, deductions, credits and tax.:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</li>
    <li>A <strong>bold, 14-point notice</strong> that you have 60 days to request abatement, printed near your address on page 1,
        including the <strong>exact calendar date</strong> by which you must respond.:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</li>
    <li>Instructions for how to contact the IRS and how to dispute the change.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Before this law, math-error notices were often short, vague and did not clearly explain your rights, which caused many
    taxpayers to miss their chance to challenge the IRS in time.:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
  </p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Key 2026 takeaway:</strong><br>
    The IRS can still change your return using math-error authority, but now the notice must clearly show:
    <ul>
      <li>What changed,</li>
      <li>Why it changed,</li>
      <li>Exactly how they calculated the new numbers, and</li>
      <li>Your 60-day deadline to fight back.</li>
    </ul>
    If the notice you receive after the effective date is vague or missing this information, you should talk to a tax
    professional – it may not meet the new legal standard.
  </div>

  <h2 id="section3">3. Your 60-day deadline – how the abatement rule works</h2>
  <p>
    The 60-day rule itself is not new – it has long been part of the Internal Revenue Code, but many taxpayers were never
    clearly told about it.:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} The IRS MATH Act simply forces the IRS to be explicit.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Here is how the 60-day abatement rule works in practice:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have <strong>60 days from the date the notice is sent</strong> to request abatement of the math error adjustment.:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}</li>
    <li>If you respond within 60 days:
      <ul>
        <li>The IRS <strong>must abate</strong> (reverse) the math-error assessment.</li>
        <li>If the IRS still thinks you owe, it must use normal <strong>deficiency procedures</strong> – which means you get
            a notice of deficiency and the right to petition the U.S. Tax Court before paying.:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If you <strong>do not</strong> respond within 60 days:
      <ul>
        <li>The assessment becomes <strong>final</strong>.</li>
        <li>You generally lose the chance to challenge the amount in Tax Court before paying.:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}</li>
        <li>Your main option then is to <strong>pay first</strong> and file a claim for refund, which is slower and more expensive.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The 60-day deadline is strict. If a mail delay or confusion causes you to miss it, talk to a tax professional
    immediately – do <strong>not</strong> ignore IRS collection notices.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section4">4. Step-by-step: how to dispute a math error notice (with sample letter)</h2>
  <p><strong>Step 1 – Read the notice carefully.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify the <strong>notice date</strong> and the <strong>exact 60-day deadline</strong> printed on page 1.</li>
    <li>Find the <strong>line number</strong> and the <strong>specific error description</strong> the IRS is relying on.:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Step 2 – Compare to your original return.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pull your filed Form 1040 and all schedules.</li>
    <li>Check whether the IRS is mis-reading a line, ignoring a schedule, or missing documentation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Step 3 – Gather supporting documents.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>W-2s, 1099s, 1098-T, brokerage statements, credit worksheets, proof of dependents, etc.</li>
    <li>If the “error” is not actually a math error (for example, it’s about eligibility or legal interpretation),
        that should be explained in your response.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Step 4 – Write a 60-day abatement request letter.</strong></p>
  <p>Your letter should clearly state that you are <strong>requesting abatement of the math-error assessment</strong> and why.</p>

Re: Request for Abatement of Math Error Assessment
Tax year: [20XX]
Notice number: [CP11/CP12 or other]
SSN: XXX-XX-[last 4]

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing within 60 days of the date on the math error notice referenced above to request abatement of
the math error assessment.

The notice states that the IRS changed the amount reported on line [line number] of my Form 1040 due to
a math or clerical error. I disagree with this adjustment for the following reasons:

[Briefly explain why the original entry was correct, or why the IRS adjustment is wrong. Reference the
attached documents.]

Attached are copies of my original tax return pages and supporting documentation that show my figures
are correct.

Please abate the math error assessment as provided under Internal Revenue Code section 6213(b)(2). If the
IRS still believes an additional tax is due after review of this information, please use the normal deficiency
procedures so that I may exercise my right to challenge any adjustment.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

[Phone number]
  </pre>

  <p><strong>Step 5 – Mail it with proof.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Send your response to the address on the notice.</li>
    <li>Use <strong>certified mail with return receipt</strong> or another trackable service so you can prove you met the 60-day deadline.</li>
    <li>Keep copies of everything you send.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Step 6 – Watch for follow-up notices.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the IRS abates the adjustment, it should send a <strong>plain-language abatement notice</strong> explaining what was reversed.:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}</li>
    <li>If the IRS still disagrees, it should proceed under normal deficiency procedures, giving you a separate notice and the opportunity to go to Tax Court.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- FAQ SECTION -->
  <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (2026)</h2>

  <h3>1. What is an IRS math error notice in 2026?</h3>
  <p>
    It is a letter where the IRS changes your return for what it views as a math or clerical error without opening a full
    audit. Starting late 2026, the IRS MATH Act requires these notices to explain the error in plain language, show the
    exact line that changed, include the math and clearly display your 60-day deadline to respond.:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
  </p>

  <h3>2. Does the new law change how my tax is calculated?</h3>
  <p>
    No. The IRS MATH Act does <strong>not</strong> change tax brackets, credits or the way foreign income, crypto or other items
    are taxed. It changes how the IRS must explain any math-error correction and how clearly it must communicate your
    60-day dispute rights.:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
  </p>

  <h3>3. What if I miss the 60-day deadline?</h3>
  <p>
    If you miss the 60-day window, the math-error assessment generally becomes final. You usually lose the right to go to
    Tax Court before paying and may have to pay first and then file a refund claim if you still disagree. In that
    situation, talk to a tax professional immediately – especially if you never received the notice or it was defective.:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
  </p>

  <h3>4. Do these rules apply if I live outside the U.S.?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. The MATH Act applies to IRS math-error notices regardless of where you live. For U.S. citizens and residents
    abroad, the new requirements should make it easier to understand adjustments and dispute them within 60 days, though
    postal delays mean you should act quickly as soon as a notice arrives.:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
  </p>

  <h3>5. Should I handle a math error notice myself or hire help?</h3>
  <p>
    For a small, clear arithmetic correction you understand and agree with, you may not need help. But if the IRS is
    disallowing credits, dependents, foreign income items, crypto basis or other complex positions, getting an enrolled
    agent, CPA or tax attorney involved can be a smart investment – especially if the amount is large or you are close to
    the 60-day deadline.
