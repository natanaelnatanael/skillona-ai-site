      <p class="subtitle">
        Airbnb, Vinted, Etsy, Bolt, Uber, Upwork and dozens of other platforms already send your income
        data to EU tax authorities under DAC7. From 2026, crypto and more payment flows join via DAC8.
        This guide explains what platforms actually report about you, how tax offices use that data, and
        how to stay compliant without paying more tax than you have to.

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <section id="section-1" class="section container">
      <h2>1. What DAC7 and DAC8 actually are (in plain language)</h2>
      <p>
        The EU has been building a system where tax authorities <strong>automatically share data</strong> about
        income and assets. Two key updates are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DAC7</strong> – covers <em>platform sellers</em> (Airbnb hosts, marketplace sellers, gig workers).</li>
        <li><strong>DAC8</strong> – adds <em>crypto and some e-money</em> to the automatic reporting system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        DAC7 is already in force. Platforms had to collect data on 2023 income, and first reports were
        sent to EU tax authorities in 2024. DAC8 follows for crypto from 2026 onward, but many people
        will feel the combined impact in the 2026–2027 filing seasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither DAC7 nor DAC8 “creates a new tax”. They simply make it much harder to <strong>not report</strong>
        income that tax offices can now see automatically.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section id="section-2" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>2. Which platforms report your income – and since when</h2>
      <p>
        Under DAC7, many digital platforms operating in the EU must report seller income to tax
        authorities. These typically include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accommodation platforms</strong> – Airbnb, Booking.com, Vrbo and similar.</li>
        <li><strong>Transport platforms</strong> – Uber, Bolt, FreeNow and similar ride/delivery apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Goods marketplaces</strong> – Vinted, Etsy, eBay and similar.</li>
        <li><strong>Service platforms</strong> – Upwork, Fiverr and other gig/freelance platforms.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="table-wrapper">
        <table class="code-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Year</th>
              <th>What platforms had to do</th>
              <th>What it means for you</th>

              <td>Your tax office may already have your 2023 platform income on file.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>2025</strong></td>
              <td>DAC7 routine continues (2024 income reported), national follow-up starts to ramp up.</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>From 2026</strong></td>
              <td>DAC7 + DAC8 data flows: platform + crypto income visibility increases.</td>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        The exact list of platforms can vary by country, but if an app pays you for renting, selling
        or providing services, it is very likely captured by DAC7-style rules.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <section id="section-3" class="section container">
      <h2>3. What data about you is sent to tax authorities</h2>
      <p>
        Under DAC7 and DAC8, platforms usually need to send three core blocks of information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your identity</strong> – name, address, date of birth, country of residence, tax ID (TIN).</li>
        <li><strong>Your account / profile</strong> – platform account ID, linked bank or payout details.</li>
        <li><strong>Your earnings</strong> – annual income from the platform, broken down by category.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For platform income (DAC7), reports normally include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>total gross income paid/credited to you in the year,</li>
        <li>fees, commissions and taxes withheld by the platform,</li>
        <li>number of transactions (e.g. nights booked, items sold),</li>
        <li>per-country breakdown if you operate in multiple jurisdictions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For crypto (DAC8), reports typically add:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>annual totals of purchases, sales and exchanges of crypto-assets,</li>
        <li>year-end balances of reportable assets,</li>
        <li>certain payments where crypto is used as a means of payment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All of this is linked to your TIN and country of residence. The data is then automatically
        shared between EU tax authorities, so activity in one country can be seen by your home country.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <section id="section-4" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>4. How tax offices use DAC7/DAC8 data in 2026</h2>
      <p>
        Once tax authorities receive platform data, they typically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>load it into central databases,</li>
        <li>match it to your tax ID and past returns, and</li>
        <li>run automated checks for mismatches.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.1. Simple matching example</h3>
      <p>
        Imagine DAC7 data shows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Airbnb gross payouts to you in 2024: €18,500.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your 2024 tax return:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>shows no rental income at all.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The system flags a mismatch. A letter is generated asking you to explain or amend your return.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2. “Nudge” letters vs. full audits</h3>
      <p>
        In the early years, many tax offices prefer “soft enforcement”:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>polite letters reminding you to declare platform income,</li>
        <li>opportunities to correct returns without heavy penalties,</li>
        <li>targeted campaigns at specific platforms or income bands.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Over time, as systems stabilize, authorities may move toward more formal audits and penalties
        for repeated or large-scale non-compliance.
      </p>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <section id="section-5" class="section container">
      <h2>5. Airbnb & short-term rental hosts – special issues</h2>
      <p>
        If you host on Airbnb, Booking or similar, DAC7 connects directly to your property income.
        Key points:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gross vs net:</strong> platforms usually report <em>gross payouts</em>, before your own expenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Local rules:</strong> some cities require registration numbers and tourist taxes in addition.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple properties:</strong> data can show how many listings you have and roughly how active they are.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On your tax return, the important thing is to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>declare the income in the correct category (rental vs business),</li>
        <li>deduct legitimate expenses (cleaning, utilities, service fees, repairs, etc.),</li>
        <li>respect any thresholds for VAT, local taxes or registration requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        DAC7 doesn’t calculate your profit; it gives tax offices a reliable starting point for your
        <strong>revenue</strong>. It is then up to you to document costs and deductions.
      </p>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <section id="section-6" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>6. Marketplace & gig workers – special issues</h2>
      <p>
        If you sell items or services on Vinted, Etsy, eBay, Upwork, Fiverr and similar platforms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>small, casual sales may be treated differently from systematic trading or business activity,</li>
        <li>some countries have de minimis thresholds for occasional sales,</li>
        <li>platform data can reveal patterns that look like a business (volume, frequency, turnover).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Typical issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>“I’m just selling my old clothes”</strong> – but volume and buying patterns suggest reselling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Freelancers treating all platform income as “hobby”</strong> – while clients and invoices show business.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ignoring VAT thresholds</strong> – especially in cross-border e-commerce within the EU.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Having a clear internal classification (hobby vs business), plus simple bookkeeping for each
        platform, is essential from 2026 onward.

      <p>
        Use this plan to put yourself in a strong position before DAC7/DAC8 letters reach your mailbox.
      </p>

      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Step 1 – List all your platforms and income streams</h3>
          <p>
            Write down:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>all platforms where you receive money (Airbnb, Uber, Vinted, etc.),</li>
            <li>what you do on each platform (rent, sell, drive, design, etc.),</li>
            <li>your user/merchant IDs and payout accounts.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 2 – Download full yearly statements from each platform</h3>
          <p>
            For the last 2–3 years, download:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>annual or monthly earnings reports,</li>
            <li>fee/commission breakdowns,</li>
            <li>transaction lists (bookings, sales, rides, gigs).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 3 – Reconcile platform income with your tax returns</h3>
          <p>
            For each year:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>compare platform-reported totals with what you declared,</li>
            <li>identify years where you under-reported or did not report at all,</li>
            <li>estimate the size of any gap.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 4 – Decide how to fix past gaps</h3>
          <p>
            Options depend on your country, but often include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>amending previous returns,</li>
            <li>using voluntary disclosure programs, where available,</li>
            <li>regularizing going forward if amounts are small and past periods are closed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 5 – Set up simple bookkeeping for 2026 onwards</h3>
          <p>
            For each platform, track:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>gross income,</li>
            <li>platform fees and commissions,</li>
            <li>other business expenses (shipping, materials, fuel, cleaning, etc.).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A spreadsheet is enough at the beginning, as long as it is kept up to date.

    <!-- Section 8 -->
    <section id="section-8" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>8. Typical mistakes that trigger letters & audits</h2>
      <p>
        The following patterns are exactly what DAC7/DAC8 data makes easy to spot:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Zero platform income declared while DAC7 shows regular earnings.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Declaring far less income than platforms report</strong> – without matching documented expenses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Frequent cross-border rentals or sales</strong> with no mention of foreign-source income on returns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Crypto sales flowing into your bank account</strong> while returns show no capital gains at all.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ignoring VAT or local business registration thresholds</strong> while platform volume suggests a business, not a hobby.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most tax offices are more interested in repeated, medium-to-large under-reporting than in
        small casual mistakes. Showing that you keep records and are trying to be compliant often
        leads to a more reasonable outcome if questions arise.

      <h2>DAC7 & DAC8 platform income – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does DAC7 tax my Airbnb or marketplace income?</h3>
        <p>
          No. DAC7 is about reporting. It obliges platforms to send your income data to tax
          authorities. How that income is taxed depends on your national rules, not DAC7 itself.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will my side hustle be treated as a business automatically?</h3>
        <p>
          Not automatically. But high volume, regular activity or clear profit motive can lead
          tax offices to treat it as a business, with obligations such as bookkeeping, VAT or
          social contributions. DAC7 data makes those patterns easier to see.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I ignore small occasional sales?</h3>
        <p>
          Some countries allow limited occasional sales with simplified treatment, but the exact
          rules vary. Even small amounts may appear in DAC7 data. It is safer to check your
          local thresholds and, if needed, declare the income correctly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does DAC8 mean every on-chain crypto transaction is reported?</h3>
        <p>
          DAC8 focuses on reportable crypto-asset service providers and their users. It does not
          directly report unhosted wallet activity, but transfers through exchanges and custodians
          can be enough to reconstruct a large part of your activity when combined with other data.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this DAC7/DAC8 platform income guide official tax advice?</h3>
        <p>
          No. It is an educational summary. For personalized advice, speak with a tax professional
          who understands both your country’s legislation and the new EU reporting rules.
