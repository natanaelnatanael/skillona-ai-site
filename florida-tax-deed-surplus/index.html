      <section id="what-is-surplus">
        <h2>1. What is Florida Tax Deed Surplus?</h2>
        <p>
          When a property in Florida is sold at a tax deed sale, the county uses the sale price to pay
          the outstanding property tax, interest, and allowed costs. If the winning bid is higher than
          the total amount owed, the difference is commonly called <strong>surplus funds</strong> or
          <strong>excess proceeds</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: if total taxes and costs are 15,000 USD and the property sells for 80,000 USD, the
          <strong>surplus</strong> would be 65,000 USD. The county typically holds this surplus for
          parties who may have a legal interest as defined by Florida law.
        </p>
        <div class="box">
          <div class="box-title">Key idea</div>
          <p>
            Surplus funds are <em>not</em> automatically distributed. To be considered for payment,
            eligible parties usually need to file a claim with the county using its official forms
            and instructions.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="who-can-claim">
        <h2>2. Who May Be Able to Claim Tax Deed Surplus?</h2>
        <p>
          Eligibility is determined by Florida statutes and county procedures. Generally, the following
          types of parties may have a potential claim to surplus, depending on lien priority and other
          factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The property owner of record on the date the tax became delinquent</li>
          <li>Heirs or beneficiaries of a deceased owner, with proper supporting documents</li>
          <li>Mortgage holders and other lienholders recorded before the tax lien, in order of priority</li>
          <li>Certain judgment creditors, depending on timing and recording</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Non-US owners can often pursue surplus claims on the same basis as US owners if they can
          document their interest and identity and follow the county’s process.
        </p>
        <div class="box box-warning">
          <div class="box-title">Note on “surplus recovery” companies</div>
          <p>
            Some companies contact owners and offer to handle surplus claims in exchange for a
            percentage of any money recovered. These arrangements are usually optional and involve
            a private contract. If you are comfortable with paperwork, you can often work directly
            with the county using its forms and keep more of the funds.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="deadlines">
        <h2>3. Deadlines and Time Limits</h2>
        <p>
          Florida law sets time limits for claims and for transferring unclaimed surplus to the State
          as unclaimed property. County websites typically explain these deadlines in more detail.
        </p>
        <p>A common pattern is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Former owners and lienholders have a defined window after the tax deed sale to submit claims</li>
          <li>After that window closes, remaining surplus may be sent to the State of Florida as unclaimed property</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once funds are transferred to the State, it may still be possible to pursue a claim through
          the unclaimed property system, but the process is different and may take longer. To avoid
          missing your opportunity at the county level, always check the specific deadline on the
          Clerk/Comptroller’s website for the county where the sale occurred.

      <section id="check-surplus">
        <h2>4. How to Check if There Is Surplus on Your Property</h2>
        <p>
          Most Florida counties maintain a public list of tax deed sales with any surplus funds shown.
          On the Clerk or Comptroller website, look for sections such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Excess Proceeds”</li>
          <li>“Surplus from Tax Deed Sales”</li>
          <li>“Tax Deed Surplus Funds”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To search correctly, you usually need some combination of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Owner name</li>
          <li>Property address</li>
          <li>Parcel ID / Folio number</li>
          <li>Tax deed sale number or case number</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Larger counties (for example, Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, Orange, Hillsborough, Duval,
          Polk and others) typically publish lists online, while smaller counties may ask you to call
          or email to inquire about potential surplus.
        </p>

      </div>

      <section id="claim-steps">
        <h2>5. Documents You Typically Need</h2>
        <p>Exact requirements are specified in the county’s claim form. Common items include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Surplus / Excess Proceeds Claim Form</strong> (official form from the county)</li>
          <li><strong>Government-issued ID</strong> (passport, driver’s license, ID card)</li>
          <li><strong>Proof of ownership</strong>, for example:
            <ul>
              <li>Recorded deed</li>
              <li>Closing statement or HUD-1/CD</li>
              <li>Property tax bill or tax notice</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Notarized affidavit</strong> or sworn statement confirming your claim</li>
          <li>If claiming as an heir:
            <ul>
              <li>Death certificate of the prior owner</li>
              <li>Affidavit of heirship and/or probate documents, if applicable</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Foreign owners can usually sign documents before a notary in their country. Some counties
          may ask for an apostille or additional authentication, so always review the instructions
          on the claim form.
        </p>

        <h2>6. How to Fill Out the Claim Form (Overview)</h2>
        <p>
          County forms differ in layout but often request similar information. Typical sections include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tax deed sale number and date</li>
          <li>Parcel ID / Folio number and property address</li>
          <li>Your contact information (name, mailing address, phone, email)</li>
          <li>Basis for your claim (former owner, heir, lienholder, etc.)</li>
          <li>Statement that you are requesting the surplus due to your interest</li>
          <li>Signature in front of a notary, acknowledging that information is true</li>
        </ul>

          <div class="box-title">Inside the PDF Kit</div>
          <p>
            The paid PDF kit includes a sample completed claim form, suggested affidavit language
            you can adapt with your own details, and a checklist so you do not miss fields that
            counties commonly reject for being incomplete.

        </div>

        <h2>7. How and Where to Submit the Claim</h2>
        <p>
          Submission methods are set by each county and are usually described on the claim form
          itself. Common options:

          <li><strong>Email</strong> – scanned, signed and notarized documents sent to an official address</li>
          <li><strong>Mail</strong> – original notarized documents mailed to the Clerk/Comptroller</li>
          <li><strong>In person</strong> – delivery at the Clerk or Comptroller’s public counter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Always use the exact email or mailing address listed on the form. If anything is unclear,
          a short call or email to the Clerk’s office can prevent delays or misdirected claims.
        </p>

        <h2>8. How Long Does Payment Take?</h2>
        <p>
          Processing times depend on the county, number of claimants and whether all documents are
          complete. Typical ranges:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simpler cases (one former owner, clear documents):</strong> often processed in a few weeks to a few months</li>
          <li><strong>Heirship or multiple claimants:</strong> can take several months or longer, especially if additional documents are requested</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Clerk may reach out for clarification, additional proof, or to resolve competing claims.
          Responding quickly and clearly usually helps keep things moving.

            Download the current form directly from the county website shortly before you file. Read
            the instructions line by line and, if you are not sure how to answer a question, ask the
            Clerk’s office how they prefer the field to be completed.

        <h2>10. DIY vs. Using Recovery Companies</h2>
        <p>
          People usually choose between three general approaches:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Do-it-yourself filing:</strong> you complete the county forms and keep the full amount paid to you</li>
          <li><strong>Attorney or professional:</strong> you pay a fee or agree to a percentage in exchange for representation</li>
          <li><strong>Surplus recovery company:</strong> you sign an agreement assigning part of the surplus as their fee</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For straightforward situations (for example, you are the clearly documented former owner
          and there are no other obvious claimants), many people feel comfortable working directly
          with the county. In more complex cases, professional advice can be useful.

        <h2>11. FAQ – Short, Practical Answers</h2>

        <h3>Can a foreign owner claim Florida tax deed surplus?</h3>
        <p>
          In many cases, yes. Eligibility is based on ownership and lien priority, not citizenship.
          You will need to prove your identity and your connection to the property using documents
          the county accepts.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need a Social Security Number?</h3>
        <p>
          Some counties process surplus claims without a US Social Security Number, especially for
          foreign owners. Others may ask for a US tax identification number for reporting purposes.
          Always follow the instructions on the county’s claim form.
        </p>

        <h3>Can someone else claim my funds?</h3>
        <p>
          Other parties generally need their own legal interest (for example, a recorded lien) or a
          document you signed, such as an assignment or power of attorney. Be cautious about signing
          contracts with anyone unless you fully understand the fee and your rights.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need a lawyer?</h3>
        <p>
          Many surplus claims are handled without lawyers, using only county forms. However, if there
          is a dispute between multiple claimants, complex heirship, or large sums, talking with an
          attorney experienced in Florida real estate or probate can be helpful.
        </p>

        <h3>Is there any fee to file the claim?</h3>
        <p>
          Counties typically do not charge a percentage fee of the surplus for filing a claim, though
          you may have costs such as notary, translation, or postage. Private companies and
          professionals charge their own fees if you hire them.
