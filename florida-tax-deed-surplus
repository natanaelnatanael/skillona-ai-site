        <h2>1. What is Florida Tax Deed Surplus?</h2>
        <p>
          When a property in Florida is sold at a tax deed sale, the county uses the sale price to pay
          the outstanding property tax, interest, and costs. If the winning bid is higher than the total
          amount owed, the difference is called <strong>surplus funds</strong> (also known as excess proceeds).
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: if total taxes and costs are 15,000 USD and the property sells for 80,000 USD, the
          <strong>surplus</strong> is 65,000 USD. These funds do not belong to the county – they are held
          for the benefit of the previous owner and other parties with a legal interest.
        </p>
        <div class="box">
          <div class="box-title">Key idea</div>
          <p>
            Surplus funds are legally owed to former owners and other qualifying parties. They will not be
            paid automatically. You must file a claim.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Who Can Claim Tax Deed Surplus?</h2>
        <p>
          Florida statutes and county rules differ slightly, but in general the following parties may be
          eligible to claim surplus funds:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The property owner of record on the date the tax became delinquent</li>
          <li>Heirs or beneficiaries of a deceased owner (with proper documentation)</li>
          <li>Mortgage holders and other lienholders recorded before the tax lien</li>
          <li>Certain judgment creditors, depending on priority</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Foreign owners (non-US residents) have the same rights as US citizens, as long as they can prove
          ownership and identity.
        </p>
        <div class="box box-warning">
          <div class="box-title">Important</div>
          <p>
            Many “surplus recovery” companies will try to contact you and take large percentages (30–50%).
            You can file the claim yourself directly with the county for free.
          </p>

        <h2>3. Deadlines (Time Limits)</h2>
        <p>
          Deadlines are set by each county, but a common pattern is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Former owners and lienholders usually have <strong>1 year</strong> from the date of the tax deed sale</li>
          <li>After the deadline, unclaimed surplus is transferred to the State of Florida as unclaimed property</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once funds become state unclaimed property, you may still be able to claim them – but the process is
          longer and more complex. It is best to act within the county deadline.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. How to Check if There Is Surplus on Your Property</h2>
        <p>
          Each Florida county maintains a public list of tax deed sales and surplus/excess funds.
          Look for sections called:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Excess Proceeds”</li>
          <li>“Surplus from Tax Deed Sales”</li>
          <li>“Tax Deed Surplus Funds”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You will typically need:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Owner name</li>
          <li>Property address</li>
          <li>Parcel ID / Folio number</li>
          <li>Tax deed sale number</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Major counties to check (examples): Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, Orange, Hillsborough,
          Duval, Polk and others.
        </p>

      <section id="claim-steps">
        <h2>5. Documents You Typically Need</h2>
        <p>Most counties will require some or all of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Surplus / Excess Proceeds Claim Form</strong> (provided by the county)</li>
          <li><strong>Government-issued ID</strong> (passport, driver’s license, ID card)</li>
          <li><strong>Proof of ownership</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>Recorded deed</li>
              <li>Closing statement</li>
              <li>Property tax bill</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Notarized affidavit</strong> confirming your claim</li>
          <li>If claiming as an heir:
            <ul>
              <li>Death certificate of the prior owner</li>
              <li>Affidavit of heirship or probate documents</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Foreign owners can use a notary in their country (for example, a notary in the EU). Some counties
          may request an apostille – always read the claim form instructions.
        </p>

        <h2>6. How to Fill Out the Claim Form (Overview)</h2>
        <p>
          Every county has its own version, but the structure is similar. Expect fields such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tax deed sale number</li>
          <li>Parcel ID / Folio number</li>
          <li>Property address</li>
          <li>Amount you claim (or “full surplus”)</li>
          <li>Your name, address, phone, email</li>
          <li>Explanation of your interest (former owner, heir, lienholder, etc.)</li>
          <li>Signature before a notary</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box">
          <div class="box-title">Inside the PDF Kit</div>
          <p>
            The paid PDF kit contains a filled-out sample claim form and affidavit language you can adapt
            to your exact situation, plus a checklist for each step.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>7. How and Where to Submit the Claim</h2>
        <p>Submission methods vary by county:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Email</strong> – scanned, signed and notarized documents</li>
          <li><strong>Mail</strong> – original documents where required</li>
          <li><strong>In person</strong> – at the Clerk or Comptroller’s office</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Instructions and email/postal addresses are usually printed directly on the county’s claim form.
          If in doubt, call the Clerk’s office and confirm the correct destination.
        </p>

        <h2>8. How Long Does Payment Take?</h2>
        <p>
          Typical timelines after you submit a complete claim:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Simple cases (single former owner):</strong> 30–90 days</li>
          <li><strong>Heirship / multiple claimants:</strong> 90–180 days or more</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Clerk may contact you for additional documents or clarification. Answer quickly to avoid delays.

        <h2>9. Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Using the wrong or outdated claim form</li>
          <li>Failing to notarize the signature where required</li>
          <li>Missing parcel number or tax deed sale number</li>
          <li>Not including proof of ownership or heirship</li>
          <li>Sending the claim to the wrong county or department</li>
          <li>Relying on third-party “surplus locators” who charge very high fees</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box box-warning">
          <div class="box-title">Tip</div>
          <p>
            Always download the latest claim form directly from the county website and follow their
            instructions exactly. If anything is unclear, call the Clerk’s office – they deal with
            surplus claims every day.

        <h2>10. DIY vs. Using Recovery Companies</h2>
        <p>
          You have three main options:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>File the claim yourself</strong> – you keep 100% of the surplus</li>
          <li><strong>Hire an attorney</strong> – pay a legal fee or percentage</li>
          <li><strong>Work with a surplus recovery company</strong> – usually pay 20–40% of the recovered funds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If your case is straightforward (you are the former owner, address is clear), filing yourself
          with this guide is often the most cost-effective route.

        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h2>11. FAQ – Short, Practical Answers</h2>

        <h3>Can a foreign owner claim Florida tax deed surplus?</h3>
        <p>Yes. You do not need to be a US citizen or resident. You must prove identity and ownership.</p>

        <h3>Do I need a Social Security Number?</h3>
        <p>
          Not always. Many counties will process foreign claims without SSN, especially if payment is by check.
          Check your county’s specific requirements.
        </p>

        <h3>Can someone else claim my funds?</h3>
        <p>
          Only if you sign an assignment or power of attorney, or if they have a legal interest (e.g. lienholder).
          Be careful when signing contracts with recovery companies.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need a lawyer?</h3>
        <p>
          Not required in most cases, but recommended if there is a dispute between multiple claimants
          or complex heirship issues.
        </p>

        <h3>Is there any fee to file the claim?</h3>
        <p>
          The county usually does not charge a fee to file a surplus claim. Recovery companies charge their own
          percentage if you hire them.
