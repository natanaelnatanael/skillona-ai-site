        <h2>1. What Is a DSCR Loan?</h2>
        <p>
          A DSCR loan is a type of real estate loan where the lender focuses primarily on the
          <strong>cash flow of the property</strong> instead of your personal salary or traditional
          income documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSCR stands for <strong>Debt Service Coverage Ratio</strong> and is often calculated as:
        </p>
        <p><strong>DSCR = Net Operating Income (NOI) / Annual Debt Service</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>NOI = gross rent – typical operating expenses (taxes, insurance, HOA, management, etc.).</li>
          <li>Debt service = principal + interest payments over a year (not including taxes/insurance if they are escrowed separately).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Example: if a property generates 24,000 USD NOI per year and annual loan payments are 18,000 USD,
          DSCR = 24,000 / 18,000 ≈ 1.33. Many lenders consider higher DSCR to be safer, but each lender sets its own thresholds.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="why-matter">
        <h2>2. Why DSCR Loans Matter for Foreign Investors</h2>
        <p>
          For non-US investors, traditional “full documentation” loans can be difficult because they often require
          US tax returns, W-2 income, domestic credit history and other documents you may not have as a foreign national.
        </p>
        <p>DSCR-style lenders generally place more weight on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Property location and overall quality.</li>
          <li>Market rent and actual leases (or realistic rent projections).</li>
          <li>Operating expenses and reserve assumptions.</li>
          <li>DSCR ratio (often a minimum in the range of ~1.0–1.25 or higher).</li>
          <li>Your down payment, liquidity and basic investor profile.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box">
          <div class="box-title">Key practical advantage</div>
          <p>
            Some DSCR lenders offer programs to foreign nationals where the underwriting is heavily based on the
            property and your assets, rather than US employment history or a long US credit file. Availability and
            terms are always lender-specific.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="terms">
        <h2>3. Typical DSCR Loan Terms (High-Level)</h2>
        <p>
          Exact numbers depend on lender, property type, leverage, your profile and overall market conditions.
          As of recent years, many investors see ranges roughly like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Loan type: 30-year fixed, or 30-year amortization with fixed or adjustable rate periods.</li>
          <li>Down payment: often around 20–30% or more for foreign national programs.</li>
          <li>Interest rate: usually higher than owner-occupied or agency loans.</li>
          <li>Minimum DSCR: commonly in the ~1.0–1.25+ range, sometimes higher for riskier deals or cash-out refis.</li>
          <li>Loan purpose: purchase or refinance of 1–4 unit investment property; some lenders also do small multifamily.</li>
          <li>Property types: SFR, some small multifamily, selected condos and townhomes; policies vary by lender.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some lenders maintain specific “foreign national DSCR” products with adjusted documentation and pricing.
          Program details can change frequently.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Basic Eligibility for Foreign Investors</h2>
        <p>Commonly requested items (examples only):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Valid passport and sometimes a secondary ID.</li>
          <li>Proof of foreign address/residency.</li>
          <li>Entity structure (often an LLC in the property state or a similar vehicle acceptable to the lender).</li>
          <li>US bank account (or acceptable escrow arrangements) for payments and reserves.</li>
          <li>Documented funds for down payment, closing costs and reserves, with source of funds explanation if required.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some lenders also ask for a basic credit report from your home country or bank reference letters.
          Foreign national programs usually come with more conservative terms than domestic-borrower DSCR loans.
        </p>

      <section id="steps">
        <h2>5. Step-by-Step: Preparing for a DSCR Loan</h2>

        <h3>Step 1 – Define your property strategy</h3>
        <p>
          Decide what kind of property you are targeting (SFR, small multifamily, condo), in which state,
          and in which price range. For DSCR deals, the <strong>numbers</strong> must make sense on paper:
          projected income should comfortably support the projected debt payments and expenses.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2 – Run a DSCR calculation before talking to lenders</h3>
        <p>Estimate realistic figures for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expected monthly rent (using current comparable rentals, not only optimistic projections).</li>
          <li>Property taxes for that address or municipality.</li>
          <li>Insurance premiums (including any required special coverage, e.g. flood or wind).</li>
          <li>HOA dues, if applicable.</li>
          <li>Maintenance, management and reserve assumptions.</li>
          <li>Projected loan payment at a conservative interest rate and realistic LTV.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If DSCR is below 1.0 in your model, many lenders will either decline the loan or ask for a
          larger down payment to bring DSCR up. Some programs also price loans more aggressively when
          DSCR is higher.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3 – Set up your entity and banking</h3>
        <p>
          Many DSCR lenders prefer lending to an LLC or similar entity for investment properties.
          Common setups include, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>LLC formed in the property state, with you as foreign-national owner.</li>
          <li>Property-state LLC owned by a holding LLC in another state, where lender permits this.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Requirements on structure differ by lender and by state law. Separate from the loan, you will
          need a way to send and receive funds through a US bank, escrow or comparable arrangement that
          your lender and closing team can work with.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4 – Prepare a simple investor package</h3>
        <p>
          Even if the loan is DSCR-based, organised documentation helps the file move faster. A basic
          investor package might include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy of passport and, if requested, a second form of ID.</li>
          <li>Proof of foreign residential address (utility bill or similar).</li>
          <li>Short investor bio (prior real estate experience, current holdings if any).</li>
          <li>Proof of funds for down payment, closing costs and reserves (bank statements, proof of deposits).</li>
          <li>Entity documents: Articles of Organization, Operating Agreement, EIN letter (if applicable).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The DSCR Playbook PDF can be used as a checklist when assembling this package, but the final
          document requirements come from your chosen lender.
        </p>

      <section id="lenders">
        <h2>6. Working with DSCR Lenders</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have a target property or at least a clear profile (location, price range, rent level),
          you can talk to DSCR lenders who explicitly state that they work with foreign nationals.
          When comparing options, consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interest rate, points and total APR.</li>
          <li>Minimum DSCR requirement and how they calculate it (market rent vs actual leases, etc.).</li>
          <li>Prepayment structure (no penalty, step-down, yield-maintenance or other models).</li>
          <li>Estimated closing costs and third-party fees.</li>
          <li>Minimum and maximum loan amounts for foreign programs.</li>
          <li>Accepted property types and locations, including any restricted states or counties.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="box box-warning">
          <div class="box-title">Warning</div>
          <p>
            A slightly lower headline rate can be worse overall if the loan has heavy prepayment penalties,
            strict lock-out periods or “gotcha” fees. Always look at the <strong>total structure</strong> and
            discuss scenarios (sell, refinance, long-term hold) with the lender before signing.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="risks">
        <h2>7. Risks and Things to Watch</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Vacancy or lower-than-expected rent can push DSCR below what you modelled.</li>
          <li>Rising property taxes or insurance costs can erode cash flow over time.</li>
          <li>DSCR loans can carry higher rates and lower maximum LTV compared to some conventional options.</li>
          <li>Refinancing assumptions (for example, expecting much lower rates later) may not materialise.</li>
          <li>Currency risk exists if your income and savings are in another currency while the loan is in USD.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          DSCR loans can be powerful tools for scaling a US rental portfolio from abroad, but they still require
          conservative underwriting, realistic rent assumptions and a clear risk plan.

      <section id="faq">
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h2>8. FAQ – Short Answers</h2>

        <h3>Can I get a DSCR loan as a foreign national with no US credit?</h3>
        <p>
          Some lenders offer foreign-national DSCR programs where US credit history is less central and more weight
          is placed on the property and your assets/down payment. Approval is never guaranteed and depends on the
          specific lender and file.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I close in an LLC?</h3>
        <p>
          Many DSCR lenders allow or prefer loans to LLCs or similar entities, with you signing as member/manager
          and sometimes providing personal guarantees. Exact requirements are lender- and state-specific.
        </p>

        <h3>What DSCR do I need?</h3>
        <p>
          Common minimums are roughly in the 1.0–1.25+ range, but some lenders want higher coverage, especially at
          higher leverage or in markets they consider riskier. Stronger DSCR can sometimes improve pricing.
        </p>

        <h3>Can short-term rentals qualify?</h3>
        <p>
          Some DSCR lenders consider short-term rental (STR) income, often with extra conditions: for example,
          requiring documented booking history, using trailing 12-month income or using market-rent assumptions
          instead of peak-season projections. Many lenders have specific STR guidelines you need to review.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need existing US tax filings?</h3>
        <p>
          For DSCR-style loans, certain lenders do not require prior US tax returns to underwrite the loan,
          especially on foreign-national programs. However, once you own US income-producing property, you
          should speak with a qualified tax professional about ongoing filing obligations.
        </p>

        <h3>Are DSCR loans “no-doc” for foreign investors?</h3>
        <p>
          They are typically <em>reduced-doc</em> or <em>alternative-doc</em>, not truly “no-doc”. Lenders still
          need property documents, entity documents, ID, proof of funds and sometimes additional information about
          you and your investments.
