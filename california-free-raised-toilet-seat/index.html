        <h2>1. Why Look for a Free / Low-Cost Raised Toilet Seat?</h2>
        <p>
          Many California households live with <strong>short stature, arthritis, recent surgery or mobility issues</strong>.
          A <strong>raised toilet seat</strong> can lower fall risk and reduce knee and hip strain, but buying one out of pocket
          (often <strong>$30–$100</strong>) is not always easy on a fixed income.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on your situation, programs like <strong>Medi-Cal (Medicaid) DME</strong>, <strong>IHSS</strong> and your
          <strong>local Area Agency on Aging</strong> may be able to provide a raised toilet seat at
          <strong>no cost or with very low cost</strong> if it’s medically necessary.
        </p>
        <div class="box box-warning">
          <div class="box-title">Reality check</div>
          <p>
            A lot of people who could qualify never hear that these options even exist. This page does not promise
            approval, but it <strong>collects the main routes in one place</strong> and gives you the exact
            questions and phrases to use when you call or apply.

      <section>
        <h2>2. Who Often Qualifies in California? (General Patterns)</h2>
        <p>
          Exact rules depend on the <strong>program, county and year</strong>, but people in the following
          situations are often eligible for help with a raised toilet seat or similar equipment:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>California residents</strong> with low or moderate income (Medi-Cal, IHSS or similar programs)</li>
          <li>People with <strong>arthritis, balance problems, neuropathy, short stature or post-surgery recovery</strong></li>
          <li>Older adults receiving home-care or services through an <strong>Area Agency on Aging</strong></li>
          <li>People whose <strong>doctor or therapist</strong> is willing to write that the item is medically necessary</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Immigration status, income limits and documentation requirements can differ between programs.
          Always ask the office directly what they require this year.
        </p>

      <section id="same-day">
        <h2>3. Fast-Track Process – California (2025 Overview)</h2>
        <p>In practice, many families in California follow a similar four-step path:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Talk to your doctor</strong> – explain why you struggle with a standard-height toilet.</li>
          <li><strong>Get a short written recommendation</strong> for a raised toilet seat (sample text below).</li>
          <li><strong>Choose the best program</strong> for your situation (Medi-Cal DME, IHSS, Area Agency on Aging).</li>
          <li><strong>Submit the form or ask the social worker</strong> to request the equipment from an approved supplier.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Some people get decisions <strong>very quickly (days)</strong>, others may wait a few weeks. Timing depends on
          caseload, county and whether the doctor’s paperwork is complete on the first try.

        <h2>5. Sample Medical Note for a Raised Toilet Seat</h2>
        <p>
          Many programs move faster when the doctor writes something short and clear. You or your family member can
          show this template to a primary-care provider, surgeon or specialist:
        </p>
        <div class="box">
          <strong>Sample California Medical Note (Raised Toilet Seat)</strong><br>
          Patient: <em>[Full Name]</em> (DOB: MM/DD/YYYY)<br>
          Diagnosis / functional limits: <em>e.g. severe knee arthritis / balance impairment / short stature / recent hip surgery</em><br>
          Recommendation: Due to the above condition(s), the patient has difficulty safely sitting down on and rising from a standard-height toilet. A <strong>raised toilet seat (4–6 inches, with or without arms)</strong> is medically appropriate to reduce fall risk and strain.<br><br>
          Provider name: [Printed Name, Credentials]<br>
          License #: [State medical license]<br>
          Signature: ____________________<br>
          Date: ____________________

      <section>
        <h2>6. Faster Options Without an In-Person Appointment</h2>
        <p>
          In many cases you do <strong>not</strong> need a separate in-person visit just for the form if you are already
          an established patient:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask if your clinic offers <strong>phone or portal visits</strong> for equipment requests.</li>
          <li>Send a <strong>secure message</strong> through the patient portal with:
            <ul>
              <li>a short description of your difficulty using the toilet, and</li>
              <li>a request to “please complete an order / note for a raised toilet seat for Medi-Cal / IHSS / AAA”.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Ask the office to <strong>fax the note directly</strong> to your health plan, DME supplier or social worker.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Exact response times depend on the clinic, but clear, specific requests usually move faster than “I need help
          with equipment” without explaining what and why.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Occupational & Physical Therapists in California</h2>
        <p>
          Some Medi-Cal plans and AAAs ask for a brief evaluation from an <strong>occupational therapist (OT)</strong>
          or <strong>physical therapist (PT)</strong> to document fall risk and home-safety needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The PDF kit includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>an example OT/PT note focused on bathroom safety</li>
          <li>a short phone script you can use when calling clinics</li>
          <li>a link to a map of typical providers that work with Medi-Cal and older adults</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8. Income & Eligibility – What Actually Matters</h2>
        <p>
          For <strong>Medi-Cal</strong>, the key question is whether you are currently enrolled or likely to qualify
          under the program’s income and asset rules. These limits change frequently and can vary by category
          (children, adults, seniors, disability, long-term care).
        </p>
        <p>
          Because numbers change from year to year, this page does <strong>not</strong> list specific dollar amounts.
          Instead, use the official channels:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Call your county Medi-Cal office or use <strong>BenefitsCal</strong> to see if you qualify.</li>
          <li>Ask your AAA or a local legal-aid office for <strong>current Medi-Cal income charts</strong>.</li>
          <li>If you are already on Medi-Cal, ask your plan directly about coverage rather than assuming you don’t qualify.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. If You Don’t Use the Internet Much</h2>
        <p>
          If online forms are difficult, you can still move things forward by phone:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Call your <strong>local Area Agency on Aging</strong> from the directory above and say:
            <em>“Can someone help me by phone with getting a raised toilet seat through Medi-Cal or a local program?”</em>
          </li>
          <li>Ask if they can <strong>mail or fax you simple forms</strong> and tell you where to return them.</li>
          <li>Some counties have <strong>senior centers or independent-living centers</strong> that will help you fill out paperwork in person.</li>

        <h2>10. FAQ – Short, Honest Answers</h2>

        <h3>How long does it usually take to get a raised toilet seat through these programs?</h3>
        <p>
          It can range from <strong>a few days to a few weeks</strong>. It depends on how quickly your doctor
          completes paperwork, how busy the county is and whether a DME supplier has items in stock.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I choose the exact height and style?</h3>
        <p>
          Often you can discuss preferred height (for example 2, 4 or 6 inches) and whether you need
          <strong>arms or side supports</strong>, but the final model will depend on what the plan or agency
          is willing to approve and what the supplier carries.
        </p>

        <h3>Will programs cover a raised toilet seat with arms?</h3>
        <p>
          In some cases, yes – especially if your doctor or therapist explains that <strong>arms are needed for safe transfers</strong>.
          Always have the provider mention arms specifically if they are important for safety.
        </p>

        <h3>What about immigration status?</h3>
        <p>
          Some California programs (especially certain AAA services and local charities) may help
          <strong>regardless of immigration status</strong>, while others are tied to specific Medi-Cal categories.
          Because rules are complex and change, the safest approach is to <strong>ask the office directly</strong>
          rather than assume you are excluded.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I sell or give away equipment paid for by a program?</h3>
        <p>
          Usually you <strong>should not</strong> sell or dispose of equipment that was provided by Medi-Cal or another
          public program without checking the paperwork. Some items are considered loans, others are yours to keep,
          but each program has its own rules.
        </p>

        <h3>Can the equipment be replaced later?</h3>
        <p>
          Many programs allow replacement after a certain period of normal wear or if your medical condition changes.
          Ask your plan or agency: <em>“How often can bathroom safety equipment like this be replaced?”</em>
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need health insurance to get help?</h3>
        <p>
          For <strong>Medi-Cal DME</strong>, yes – you generally need to be enrolled. For <strong>Area Agency on Aging</strong>
          or local charities, sometimes <strong>no insurance</strong> is required; they focus on age, income and safety needs.
        </p>

        <h3>Can children get a raised toilet seat covered?</h3>
        <p>
          In many cases, children with medical or developmental conditions can receive bathroom equipment through
          <strong>pediatric Medi-Cal benefits (including EPSDT)</strong>, but this must be confirmed with the child’s doctor
          and health plan.
        </p>

        <h3>What if my request is denied?</h3>
        <p>
          Most programs have a <strong>formal appeal or grievance process</strong>. You can usually ask for the decision in writing
          and then file an appeal with help from a legal-aid office, disability-rights group or benefits counselor.
          The PDF kit includes a generic appeal-letter template you can adapt.
