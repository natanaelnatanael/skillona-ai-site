<h2 id="section1">1. Overview of the 2026 Tenant Rights Changes</h2>
<p>
  The 2026 tenant protection wave is one of the largest in recent years. Multiple states and major cities have introduced renter protection packages to improve fairness in housing access, remove discriminatory screening practices, and improve transparency in fees and rental terms.
</p>

<p>Core 2026 themes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Limits on background checks and use of eviction history.</li>
  <li>Fair application fee caps tied to actual screening costs.</li>
  <li>Income-to-rent ratio protections to reduce unfair denials.</li>
  <li>Upgraded notice requirements for rent increases and adverse actions.</li>
  <li>New anti-discrimination protections under expanded fair housing rules.</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
  <strong>Key takeaway for 2026:</strong><br>
  Landlords now have stricter rules on what they can ask, what they can charge, and what screening data they can use. Tenants have more tools than ever to challenge unfair denials.
</div>


<h2 id="section2">2. New Screening & Background Check Limits</h2>
<p>
  One of the biggest 2026 shifts concerns rental screening. Many jurisdictions now restrict:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use of eviction records older than 3–7 years.</li>
  <li>Use of eviction filings that never resulted in a judgment.</li>
  <li>Use of sealed, expunged, or pandemic-era eviction cases.</li>
  <li>Automatic denials based on credit scores alone.</li>
  <li>Use of criminal history unrelated to housing safety.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Several states now require landlords to provide an <strong>“individualized assessment”</strong> rather than blanket automated denials. This means the landlord must evaluate:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reason for past eviction.</li>
  <li>Time elapsed since incident.</li>
  <li>Tenant's current income and stability.</li>
  <li>Rehabilitation or changed circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Some cities introduced “first-in-time” laws requiring landlords to process applications chronologically and document reasons for any denial.
</p>


<h2 id="section3">3. New Rules on Rents, Fees & Income Requirements</h2>
<p>
  Rent-related protections in 2026 expand transparency and fairness:
</p>

<h3>Application Fee Caps</h3>
<p>
  Many states now cap application fees to the <strong>actual cost</strong> of the screening report, typically $20–$50. Some jurisdictions fully ban non-refundable fees.
</p>

<h3>Income-to-Rent Ratio Laws</h3>
<p>
  Several states introduced rules restricting automatic denials based on standard ratios like “3x rent.” Landlords may now be required to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consider co-signers or alternative documentation.</li>
  <li>Use net income instead of gross income.</li>
  <li>Evaluate total household income rather than individual income.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rent Increase Notices</h3>
<p>
  Many areas now require:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>60–90 day notice for rent increases.</li>
  <li>Higher notice periods for increases above set thresholds.</li>
  <li>Limits on frequency of increases.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="section4">4. Eviction Protections & Fair Housing Updates</h2>

<h3>Eviction Filing Transparency Rules</h3>
<p>
  Several states now prohibit reporting eviction filings until:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A judgment is entered, OR</li>
  <li>A threshold number of days has passed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>"Good Cause" Eviction Limits</h3>
<p>
  More states are adopting “good cause” eviction standards requiring landlords to provide:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Documented lease violations, or</li>
  <li>Nonpayment of rent, or</li>
  <li>Substantial evidence of nuisance or damage</li>
</ul>

<h3>Expanded Fair Housing Protections</h3>
<p>
  Updates include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ban on discrimination based on source of income.</li>
  <li>Stronger protections for families with children.</li>
  <li>Protections for victims of domestic violence, allowing emergency lease breaks.</li>
  <li>Limitations on criminal history use unless directly housing-related.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="section5">5. How Tenants Can Use the New Laws</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Request written reasons for any rental denial (“adverse action notice”).</li>
  <li>Challenge illegal screening practices under 2026 law.</li>
  <li>Report landlords who charge excessive or unlawful fees.</li>
  <li>Request correction of inaccurate tenant screening reports.</li>
  <li>Use expanded fair housing protections to challenge discriminatory practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Tenants denied housing may also request landlords’ screening criteria, which must now be publicly disclosed in many states.
</p>
