      <section id="why">
        <h2>1. Why Adaptive Pedal Extensions Matter</h2>
        <p>
          Many drivers live with short stature, limb loss, arthritis, neuropathy or other conditions
          that make reaching standard pedals uncomfortable or unsafe. Adaptive pedal extensions,
          left-foot accelerators and similar devices can bring the pedals closer or change how they
          are operated so the driver can maintain a safe position and better vehicle control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out-of-pocket, high-quality adaptive pedal systems can cost several hundred dollars or more
          including installation. Some US programs can help pay for this equipment when it is medically
          necessary and part of a safe-driving plan.
        </p>
        <div class="box box-warning">
          <div class="box-title">Key idea</div>
          <p>
            Many people never ask whether adaptive equipment might be funded through Medicaid,
            waiver programs, vocational rehabilitation or driver rehab. If driving is important
            for work, school or independence, it is often worth checking all of these options.

      <section id="who-qualifies">
        <h2>2. Who May Qualify for Help With Pedal Extensions?</h2>
        <p>Exact rules differ by state and program, but common eligibility themes include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Documented physical condition affecting safe access to the pedals</li>
          <li>Short stature where a safe seating position and pedal reach conflict</li>
          <li>Lower-limb amputation, muscle weakness or neurological conditions</li>
          <li>Need to drive for work, education, caregiving or community participation</li>
          <li>Meeting income or disability criteria for Medicaid, waivers or vocational rehab</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some state programs are open to a wide range of disabilities as long as an occupational
          therapist or physician documents that adaptive driving equipment is clinically appropriate.

        <h2>4. Medicaid &amp; Waivers – Step-by-Step</h2>
        <p>
          Many state Medicaid and waiver programs have a path for medically necessary durable medical
          equipment or vehicle modifications, especially when an OT or physician documents that it
          supports independence and safety.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Check basic eligibility.</strong> Review your state’s Medicaid or waiver rules for adults with disabilities or low income.</li>
          <li><strong>Confirm that vehicle modifications or adaptive equipment may be covered.</strong> Look under “DME,” “home and community-based waivers” or “vehicle modifications.”</li>
          <li><strong>Ask your doctor for a referral to an occupational therapist (OT) with driving experience.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Complete a driving evaluation.</strong> The OT can recommend specific pedal extensions or left-foot controls if appropriate.</li>
          <li><strong>Work with the provider to submit a prior authorization request.</strong> This often includes OT notes, a prescription and a supplier quote.</li>
          <li><strong>Once approved, the supplier installs the equipment.</strong> Ask what costs, if any, remain your responsibility.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="box">
          <div class="box-title">Inside the PDF kit</div>
          <p>
            The kit includes a sample prior-authorization cover letter, a checklist of typical
            Medicaid documentation and a simple worksheet you can hand to your OT so they know
            what information the insurer usually wants.

        <h2>5. Vocational Rehabilitation – Step-by-Step</h2>
        <p>
          State vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies help people with disabilities prepare for,
          get and keep employment. When driving is essential for work or training, VR may be able
          to fund adaptive driving equipment as part of an Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE).
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Locate your state VR agency.</strong> Use the federal RSA directory: <a href="https://rsa.ed.gov/about/states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rsa.ed.gov/about/states</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Apply for VR services.</strong> You’ll be asked about your disability and employment goals.</li>
          <li><strong>Show how driving fits into your work plan.</strong> For example: commuting to a job, delivering goods, home-health work, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Complete evaluations.</strong> VR may send you to a driver rehab specialist or OT to document what equipment is needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Agree on an IPE that includes adaptive driving equipment.</strong> Funding is usually tied to this written plan.</li>
          <li><strong>Follow VR’s process for equipment and installation.</strong> In many cases, VR contracts directly with approved vendors.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="box">
          <div class="box-title">Tip</div>
          <p>
            Be clear with your counselor about how driving directly affects your ability to get
            and keep a job. The stronger the connection, the easier it is for VR to justify equipment
            as part of your plan.

        <h2>6. Driver Rehab &amp; DMV-Linked Adaptive Equipment</h2>
        <p>
          Some states work closely with certified driver rehabilitation specialists and may have
          DMV processes for adding adaptive equipment restrictions or approvals to your license.
          These processes don’t necessarily pay for equipment by themselves, but they can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide a formal evaluation that supports funding requests</li>
          <li>Ensure your license accurately reflects any necessary restrictions or equipment</li>
          <li>Connect you with trusted installers and vehicle modification vendors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In a typical path, you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Obtain a medical form from your DMV or licensing agency</li>
          <li>Have your physician or OT complete it, indicating the need for adaptive controls</li>
          <li>Undergo a specialized road test with adaptive equipment</li>
          <li>Use the report to support funding through Medicaid, VR or private insurance</li>

        <h2>7. Occupational Therapist (OT) Driving Evaluations</h2>
        <p>
          An OT or driver rehabilitation specialist is often the key to getting the right equipment
          and having it funded. Their evaluation typically covers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Strength, range of motion, reaction time and vision</li>
          <li>How far you can safely reach the pedals while maintaining good posture</li>
          <li>Which type of pedal extension or left-foot control fits your vehicle and body</li>

        <h2>8. Example Income Numbers (Medicaid Context)</h2>
        <p>
          Many Medicaid programs for adults use income thresholds based on the Federal Poverty Level
          (FPL). Exact amounts and percentages change almost every year and differ by state. The table

        <h2>10. FAQ – Short, Practical Answers</h2>

        <h3>How long does it usually take to get adaptive pedal extensions?</h3>
        <p>
          For people who qualify and submit complete paperwork, some programs can move in a matter of
          weeks, while others take longer due to evaluations, authorizations and scheduling. Asking
          each program for their current typical timeline is the safest approach.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I choose the exact brand or model?</h3>
        <p>
          Many payers have preferred vendors or product lists, but driver rehab specialists often
          work with recognized brands of adaptive driving equipment. If you have a specific brand
          in mind, discuss it with your OT, vendor and funding source before installation.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I get a left-foot accelerator instead of pedal extensions?</h3>
        <p>
          In some cases, yes. Left-foot accelerators are common for drivers who cannot safely use
          the right leg. Whether they are funded depends on medical need, program rules and the
          vehicle. A driving evaluation usually determines which option is safest.
        </p>

        <h3>What about immigration status?</h3>
        <p>
          Eligibility rules are complex and state-specific. Some programs look primarily at medical
          need and residence, while others have specific citizenship or immigration requirements.
          Program staff or legal aid organizations in your state can explain what applies to you.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I always get equipment for free?</h3>
        <p>
          Not necessarily. Some people have all costs paid by a program, others pay part of the cost,
          and others do not qualify at all. The goal of this guide is to help you find and navigate
          the programs that may exist in your state so you can ask informed questions.
        </p>

        <h3>Can children or teens be considered?</h3>
        <p>
          In some situations, children or teens preparing to drive with a disability may be evaluated
          for adaptive equipment through Medicaid’s EPSDT benefit, children’s waivers or pediatric
          driver rehab programs. This is very state-specific and should be confirmed with your providers.
        </p>

        <h3>What can I do if my request is denied?</h3>
        <p>
          Many programs have formal appeal or reconsideration processes. The kit includes sample
          appeal letters you can adapt, but it can also be helpful to ask your clinician to clarify
          the medical need or to contact a local disability rights or legal aid organization.
