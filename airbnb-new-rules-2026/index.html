  <h2 id="section1">1. What are the new Airbnb rules for hosts in 2026?</h2>
  <p>
    In 2026, Airbnb introduced several new rules for hosts, including updated registration requirements, guest screening processes,
    and occupancy limits. These changes are aimed at improving safety, compliance with local regulations, and ensuring that hosts
    follow Airbnb's updated policies. These rules also apply to hosts in popular tourist destinations as well as those operating
    in regions with high demand for short-term rentals.
  </p>
  <p>
    **Key Changes for Hosts:**
    <ul>
      <li>Hosts must register their properties with local authorities in certain cities.</li>
      <li>Airbnb will now require background checks for all guests, along with identity verification for new accounts.</li>
      <li>Occupancy limits may apply based on the size of the property and local laws, which could affect booking availability for large groups.</li>
      <li>New cancellation policies for guests and hosts to help minimize fraud and cancellations.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 id="section2">2. What new registration requirements are there for Airbnb hosts?</h2>
  <p>
    Airbnb has now mandated that hosts in certain locations must register with local authorities. This will help ensure that properties
    are compliant with zoning laws, building codes, and tax regulations. In some cities, hosts must display their registration number
    on their listings. This registration helps track rental activity and allows local governments to enforce occupancy limits and
    tax short-term rental income.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section3">3. How do the new guest screening requirements affect Airbnb hosts?</h2>
  <p>
    Starting in 2026, Airbnb will require all guests to undergo a background check before booking a property. This includes verifying
    their identity using government-issued IDs, email, and phone number checks. Additionally, guest profiles will be reviewed for
    previous complaints or issues related to property damage or conduct violations. These enhanced screening measures aim to protect
    hosts and guests alike by ensuring that only responsible individuals are allowed to stay in short-term rental properties.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section4">4. How will Airbnb's new occupancy limits affect hosts?</h2>
  <p>
    In 2026, Airbnb will implement new occupancy limits for certain types of properties. These limits will be based on local
    regulations and will vary by city or region. Hosts with larger properties may face restrictions on the number of guests they
    can accommodate, while hosts in high-demand areas may need to adjust their pricing and availability to meet these new regulations.
  </p>
