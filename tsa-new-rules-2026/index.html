  <h2 id="section1">1. Overview of TSA Rules in 2026</h2>
  <p>
    TSA’s core mission has not changed: keep flights secure while moving passengers through checkpoints as safely and quickly as possible.
    The main structure of the liquid rules, carry-on screening and identity checks is still in place in 2026, but guidance around
    <strong>breast milk, baby formula, medical liquids and special needs</strong> has become more detailed and better enforced.
  </p>
  <p>
    For travelers, the most important point is this:
    <strong>many items that look like “liquids” at first glance – breast milk, formula, medications – are treated as exceptions to the usual 3.4 oz rule</strong>,
    as long as you declare them and allow additional screening.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Key principle:</strong> Normal liquids are limited. But items needed to feed a baby, treat a medical condition or support a disability get extra protections – they are allowed in “reasonable quantities” and screened separately instead of being automatically thrown away.
  </div>

  <h2 id="section2">2. Breast Milk, Baby Formula & Infant Liquids – Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    TSA policy gives strong protections to parents and caregivers traveling with breast milk, formula, and related items. These protections continue to apply in 2026 and are increasingly recognized and enforced at checkpoints.
  </p>

  <h3>What you can bring</h3>
  <p>You may normally bring, in your carry-on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Breast milk (fresh or frozen)</li>
    <li>Baby formula (ready-to-feed, liquid or powder mixed with water)</li>
    <li>Juice or water for infants or toddlers</li>
    <li>Ice packs, gel packs and freezer packs to keep them cold</li>
    <li>Breast pump, bottles, storage bags, nursing supplies</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These items are allowed even if individual containers are larger than 3.4 oz (100 ml). They are treated as
    <strong>“medically or nutritionally necessary liquids”</strong>, not as standard toiletries.
  </p>

  <h3>Do you need the baby with you?</h3>
  <p>
    TSA guidance allows travelers to carry breast milk even when the child is not present – for example, a parent flying home with
    pumped milk or traveling alone on business. You should tell the officer that the milk is for feeding an infant or child.
  </p>

  <h3>How to go through screening with breast milk & formula</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Before screening, <strong>tell the officer</strong> you have breast milk, formula or infant liquids.</li>
    <li>Place them in a separate bin or present them separately from your other liquids and electronics.</li>
    <li>Officers may use test strips or other tools to screen the liquids without opening every container.</li>
    <li>If you are uncomfortable with a proposed screening method, you can request <strong>alternate screening</strong> and a supervisor.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You can also request that pumps and accessories be handled respectfully and not placed directly on dirty surfaces.
  </p>

  <h3>Practical tips for parents</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Label bottles clearly (e.g. “breast milk”).</li>
    <li>Keep everything organized in one insulated bag.</li>
    <li>Arrive early so you are not rushed during additional screening.</li>
    <li>Know that you can politely remind officers that breast milk and formula are allowed in larger quantities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="section3">3. Medications, Medical Liquids & Special Health Needs</h2>
  <p>
    TSA rules also make exceptions for many <strong>prescription medications and medical liquids</strong>, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Liquid medicines and syrups</li>
    <li>Saline solution and contact lens solution</li>
    <li>Liquid nutrition drinks for medical conditions</li>
    <li>Cooling gel packs for medication</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These items may exceed 3.4 oz as long as they are reasonably necessary for your trip. You should declare them at the checkpoint, keep them separate from standard liquids, and carry them in original packaging or with a prescription label where possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Travelers with disabilities or medical needs can also:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Request a private screening area</li>
    <li>Ask that certain devices (like insulin pumps) not be X-rayed and instead be swab-tested</li>
    <li>Use the TSA Cares program hotline before flying to get individualized guidance</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="section4">4. Standard Liquids Rule (3-1-1), Toiletries & Drinks</h2>
  <p>
    For most other liquids, gels and aerosols, the standard TSA liquid rule still applies in 2026:
    each passenger may bring liquids in containers up to 3.4 oz (100 ml), all fitting in a single,
    quart-sized, clear zip-top bag, with one bag per traveler.
  </p>

  <h3>Examples of items subject to the 3-1-1 rule:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Shampoo, conditioner, body wash</li>
    <li>Lotions, creams, gels</li>
    <li>Toothpaste</li>
    <li>Hair styling products</li>
    <li>Perfume and cologne</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Drinks and regular bottled water bought outside security are not allowed through the checkpoint in containers larger than 3.4 oz.
    However, once you pass security, you can buy drinks airside and bring them on the plane.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section5">5. Electronics, Laptops, Food & New Screening Tech</h2>
  <p>
    As TSA installs more modern screening machines, some airports allow you to keep more items in your bag, while others still
    require removal of laptops and large electronics. Rules can differ by checkpoint.
  </p>

  <h3>General 2026 expectations:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Laptops and tablets may need to be removed and placed in a separate bin.</li>
    <li>Large electronics (gaming consoles, big cameras) may also be screened separately.</li>
    <li>Solid food is usually allowed, but may be inspected more closely if it obscures the X-ray image.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Newer computed tomography (CT) scanners allow clearer 3D imaging of bags, which in some airports means fewer items have to be removed.
    However, you should always follow the directions of the officers at the specific lane you are using.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section6">6. TSA PreCheck, ID Rules & Family/Disability Screening</h2>
  <p>
    TSA PreCheck continues to give eligible travelers a faster lane with fewer removals (shoes, belts, laptops often stay in bags).
    In 2026, more airports and airlines are integrated into PreCheck.
  </p>

  <h3>PreCheck basics:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Requires application, background check and fee.</li>
    <li>Once approved, your Known Traveler Number (KTN) must be on your reservation.</li>
    <li>Children traveling with an eligible parent can usually use the PreCheck lane.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    All adult travelers must show acceptable ID (passport, driver’s license, or other TSA-approved identification).  
    If you forget your ID, TSA may still allow you to fly after additional identity verification, but the process will take longer.
  </p>

  <h3>Families & travelers with disabilities</h3>
  <p>
    TSA rules make it clear that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Parents may carry children through metal detectors.</li>
    <li>Strollers and car seats will be screened but are allowed at the checkpoint.</li>
    <li>Travelers with disabilities can request modified screening procedures.</li>
  </ul>
