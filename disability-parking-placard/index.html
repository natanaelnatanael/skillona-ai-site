        <h2>1. What Is a Disability Parking Placard?</h2>
        <p>
          A disability parking placard or special license plate allows a qualified person to
          park in designated accessible spaces and, in some states, receive additional
          parking accommodations (for example, extended time limits or meter exemptions).
          It is usually issued to the <strong>person</strong>, not the vehicle, and can
          generally be used in any car you are driving or riding in, as long as the
          placard holder is present.
        </p>
        <div class="box">
          <div class="box-title">Common types</div>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Permanent</strong> – often valid 2–6 years (varies by state), and frequently no fee or a low fee.</li>
            <li><strong>Temporary</strong> – often 3–12 months, with modest fees in many states.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
            Exact validity periods, parking privileges and fees are set by each state and sometimes
            by local ordinances. Always check your specific state’s instructions.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Who Typically Qualifies?</h2>
        <p>Typical qualifying conditions (the exact list and wording varies by state):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inability to walk a certain distance (for example, 200 feet) without resting.</li>
          <li>Requirement for portable oxygen or comparable medical equipment.</li>
          <li>Severe cardiac, lung, or neurological conditions that limit mobility.</li>
          <li>Loss of use or significant limitation of lower extremities or both hands.</li>
          <li>Legal blindness or severely limited vision, where allowed by state law.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In most states, only a <strong>licensed medical professional</strong>
          (for example, MD, DO, NP, PA, and in some states chiropractors or optometrists)
          can certify that you meet the legal criteria. The PDF kit includes a
          <strong>sample doctor-letter template</strong> you can customise and review
          with your provider.

        <h2>3. Four-Step Universal Process (Check Your State for Details)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Download your state form</strong> (see links in the table below).</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ask your doctor or other authorised professional</strong> to complete the
            medical certification section or supporting letter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Submit to the DMV or licensing agency</strong> – options may include online,
            mail, or in-person depending on the state.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Receive your placard or plate</strong> – many states process applications
            within roughly 1–4 weeks, but time frames differ.

        <h2>6. Online vs Mail vs In-Person – Pros &amp; Cons</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Online (selected states):</strong>
            some states (for example, California and certain Florida counties, as well as others)
            offer online options, especially for <em>renewals</em> or replacement placards.
            This can be quick and you usually receive immediate confirmation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mail:</strong>
            often 1–4 weeks processing time, but no appointment needed. Using
            certified mail gives you proof of submission; the kit includes a basic
            mailing checklist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>In-person:</strong>
            can be faster in some locations if appointments are available and all
            documents are complete, but wait times differ widely between offices.

      <section class="faq">
        <h2>7. FAQ – Common Questions</h2>

        <h3>How long does it usually take to receive the placard?</h3>
        <p>
          Processing times vary by state and by how busy local offices are. Many applicants
          report receiving placards within roughly 1–3 weeks after the DMV receives a
          complete application, but it can be faster or slower. Your state DMV is the
          only reliable source for current time frames.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I use my placard in another state?</h3>
        <p>
          In general, U.S. states commonly recognise valid disability placards from other
          states, but specific parking privileges (such as free meters or time-limit
          exemptions) can differ. Always read local signs and, when in doubt, check the
          state or city website for rules about out-of-state placards.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I get a placard for a temporary condition (for example, a broken leg)?</h3>
        <p>
          Many states offer temporary disability placards for conditions expected to
          improve, such as a fracture or post-surgery recovery. Duration and requirements
          depend on the state; your medical professional should indicate whether the
          condition is temporary on the official form.
        </p>

        <h3>Is there a fee?</h3>
        <p>
          Some states charge no fee for certain permanent disability placards, while
          others charge modest fees for placards or plates. Temporary placards often
          have small fees. Check the current fee schedule on your state DMV or licensing
          agency website.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I apply online?</h3>
        <p>
          A growing number of states offer online or partially online options, especially
          for renewals or replacements. Initial applications with new medical
          certifications often still require mail or in-person submission. Your state DMV
          site will show what is currently allowed.
        </p>

        <h3>Can non-citizens or people without a U.S. driver’s license apply?</h3>
        <p>
          Identification requirements vary. Some states allow applications with an
          ID card, passport or other approved documents; others may request a
          Social Security number or similar identifier. Check your state’s form and
          instructions or contact the DMV directly for their exact requirements.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I have more than one placard?</h3>
        <p>
          Many states limit how many active placards one person may have, but some
          allow more than one in specific situations (for example, where a person uses
          more than one vehicle). The state application or FAQ usually explains how
          many placards are permitted and how they may be used.
        </p>

        <h3>What if my placard is lost or stolen?</h3>
        <p>
          Most states have a replacement process and form (for example, California’s
          REG 156 for certain situations). Typically you report the loss, complete the
          replacement section, and follow the state’s instructions. Fees and procedures
          differ, so always use the latest state form.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I dispute a denial?</h3>
        <p>
          If an application is denied or delayed, some states allow an appeal,
          reconsideration or the submission of additional medical information.
          The denial notice or DMV website usually lists contact details or procedures
          for requesting review.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I always need a new doctor letter to renew?</h3>
        <p>
          For permanent disabilities, several states allow renewal without a new
          medical certification every time, while others require periodic
          recertification. The renewal notice or placard itself often includes
          instructions. Always follow the directions provided by your state.
