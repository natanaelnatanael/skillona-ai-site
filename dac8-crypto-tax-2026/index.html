      <h2>1. What DAC8 is and when it starts for crypto users</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>DAC8</strong> is the eighth update to the EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation in tax matters.
        It extends automatic information exchange rules to <strong>crypto-assets</strong>, alongside other items such
        as certain e-money and rulings for individuals. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
      </p>
      <p>
        For crypto users, the key dates are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>By 31 December 2025</strong> – EU countries must write DAC8 rules into their national laws. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>From 1 January 2026</strong> – crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) must
          start <strong>collecting and verifying</strong> data on reportable EU users and their transactions. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Between 1 January and late 2027</strong> – first DAC8 crypto reports for the 2026 year
          are filed and exchanged between tax authorities (deadlines differ slightly by country,
          but late 2027 is typical). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At the same time, the OECD’s <strong>Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF)</strong> will make it normal
        for many non-EU countries and traditional “offshore hubs” to exchange crypto data from around 2027.
        Together, DAC8 + CARF are designed to make hidden crypto incomes and gains much harder to keep
        off the radar. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

    <section id="section-2" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>2. Who and what is in scope: users, platforms & assets</h2>
      <p>
        DAC8 is not aimed directly at small holders. It targets the <strong>platforms</strong> you use – but the
        result is that your data will flow to tax offices automatically.
      </p>

              <td>Not directly, but related on/off-ramp and trading activity may still be reported.</td>

      </div>

      <p>
        In short: if you are an <strong>EU tax resident</strong> and you use any serious exchange, broker or custodial
        wallet, you should assume that your identity and transactions from 2026 onward will be known to
        your tax authority, even if the platform is based outside the EU.

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <section id="section-3" class="section container">
      <h2>3. What data exchanges will report about you from 2026</h2>
      <p>
        DAC8 aligns with the OECD CARF approach. Reports from platforms to tax authorities will typically
        include: :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Identity data</strong> – name, address, country of residence, date of birth, TIN (tax ID), etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Account identifiers</strong> – user IDs, account numbers, possibly linked wallet identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Annual totals of transactions</strong> – per asset:
          <ul>
            <li>purchases and sales of crypto for fiat,</li>
            <li>crypto-to-crypto swaps,</li>
            <li>transfers in and out, and</li>
            <li>certain retail payment transactions above a value threshold.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Year-end balances</strong> – holdings of reportable crypto-assets at year end.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In many countries, platforms will need to keep this data for <strong>at least five years</strong> and share it
        with tax authorities in a standardized digital format. EU tax offices will then automatically exchange
        this data with each other, similar to existing bank-account reporting under CRS. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <section id="section-4" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>4. Real impact on everyday EU crypto holders</h2>
      <p>
        DAC8 does <strong>not</strong> itself set new tax rates for individuals – those remain national. What it does is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make it much easier for tax offices to see if you are <strong>under-reporting or not reporting</strong> crypto
          income and gains.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enable automated cross-checks between your tax return and platform reports, triggering letters or audits
          when there are gaps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce the advantage of “keeping everything offshore” for EU residents. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some countries are already tightening domestic rules alongside DAC8. For example, one EU jurisdiction
        has announced a <strong>10% capital gains tax on crypto from 2026</strong>, with historical gains up to
        31 December 2025 exempted if properly documented – a clear sign of how governments may combine new
        transparency with new taxes. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
      </p>
      <p>
        For normal holders, the message is simple:
        <strong>assume your tax office will have a decent picture of your exchange-based activity from 2026 onward.</strong>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <section id="section-5" class="section container">
      <h2>5. Step-by-step: What to do before 1 January 2026</h2>
      <p>
        Use the remaining time before DAC8 data collection begins to get ahead of the curve. Here is a practical
        checklist for EU residents.
      </p>

      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Step 1 – Map all your platforms and wallets</h3>
          <p>
            Make a list of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>all exchanges you have ever used (EU and non-EU),</li>
            <li>any custodial wallets or brokers, and</li>
            <li>your main self-custody wallets (for tracking flows in and out).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Mark which ones still hold assets and which are closed or inactive.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 2 – Export full history from exchanges now</h3>
          <p>
            Before interfaces change or accounts are closed, download:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>complete trade histories (CSV) from each platform,</li>
            <li>deposit and withdrawal logs, and</li>
            <li>staking, lending or reward histories where relevant.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Store copies safely. You will need them if a tax office questions historical gains or losses later.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 3 – Reconstruct your cost basis up to 31 December 2025</h3>
          <p>
            Use your exports to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>track how you acquired each asset (purchase, swap, airdrop, mining, etc.),</li>
            <li>assign cost basis in your local currency at the time, and</li>
            <li>identify coins or tokens with large unrealized gains or losses.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In countries that “grandfather” pre-2026 gains or use special transitional rules, good documentation
            of your historical positions can be worth a lot of money. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 4 – Understand your own country’s rules</h3>
          <p>
            Check official tax authority guidance or trusted summaries for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>how your country taxes crypto (capital gains, income, wealth, etc.),</li>
            <li>how long you must keep records, and</li>
            <li>whether transitional rules apply around 2025–2026.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 5 – Consider tidying up before transparency increases</h3>
          <p>
            Depending on your situation and local law, you may want to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>regularize past years if you never reported crypto at all,</li>
            <li>simplify your platform footprint (fewer exchanges, clearer flows),</li>
            <li>close “dead” accounts that create noise but no benefit.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For substantial amounts or complex histories, it is often worth speaking to a professional before
            making big moves.
          </p>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <section id="section-6" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>6. Your yearly routine from 2026 onwards</h2>
      <p>
        Once DAC8 is live, treat crypto like any other investment account with automatic reporting:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Each year:</strong> export your trading and transaction history, reconcile it with your own records,
          and calculate gains, losses and income according to your national rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>At tax time:</strong> file your return including crypto, and make sure what you report is broadly
          consistent with what platforms are likely to report.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>After filing:</strong> keep all supporting documents (CSVs, statements, screenshots) for as long as
          your country requires – often 5–10 years.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many users will choose to use <strong>crypto tax software</strong> that can import DAC8-style exports and
        generate country-specific reports, rather than manually tracking everything in spreadsheets.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 7 -->
    <section id="section-7" class="section container">
      <h2>7. Risks of ignoring DAC8 (and why “offshore” is not a fix)</h2>
      <p>
        The biggest mistake is to assume DAC8 is only a problem for exchanges or “whales”.
        For EU residents, typical risks are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Mismatch letters:</strong> your tax office receives DAC8 data from platforms but sees nothing
          about crypto on your tax return. Automated systems may send a letter asking you to explain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Estimated assessments:</strong> in some countries, tax authorities can estimate your tax based
          on partial data if you do not respond, sometimes assuming worst-case scenarios.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Penalties and interest:</strong> unpaid tax can trigger penalties and interest, especially if
          authorities consider the non-reporting deliberate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Retroactive headaches:</strong> reconstructing years of crypto history when you are under
          pressure is much harder than doing it now while things are calm.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Trying to “escape DAC8” by using non-EU exchanges is also weak: DAC8 deliberately covers
        <strong>non-EU platforms with EU users</strong>, and CARF extends similar reporting to many non-EU countries.
        The direction of travel is clear: less secrecy, more automatic data flows. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

      <h2>DAC8 crypto tax 2026 – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does DAC8 itself tax my crypto?</h3>
        <p>
          No. DAC8 is about information exchange, not setting new tax rates. It makes it easier
          for tax authorities to see your crypto activity. How much tax you pay still depends
          on your country’s own rules.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I avoid DAC8 by using a non-EU exchange?</h3>
        <p>
          In general, no. DAC8 explicitly targets non-EU platforms with EU-resident users, and
          global frameworks like CARF push many countries to exchange crypto data. If you are
          an EU resident, offshore platforms will often still report on you.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will my self-custody wallet be reported under DAC8?</h3>
        <p>
          Non-custodial wallets themselves are not directly regulated by DAC8, but exchanges
          and custodial providers will report transfers to and from such wallets. Combined
          with on-chain analysis under CARF-style reporting, this can link some wallet activity
          to your identity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need to do anything for past years before 2026?</h3>
        <p>
          DAC8 reporting starts with transactions from 2026, but some countries already ask
          about earlier years and may introduce special rules around 2025–2026. If you never
          reported crypto at all, it is wise to discuss your situation with a professional
          before DAC8 data starts flowing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this DAC8 crypto guide official EU or tax authority guidance?</h3>
        <p>
          No. It is an educational summary based on public sources. For official details, you
          should read your national DAC8 implementation law and any guidance published by your
          country’s tax authority.
