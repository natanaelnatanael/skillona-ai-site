    <section id="section-1" class="section container">
      <h2>1. What is the One Big Beautiful Bill and when it applies</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>One Big Beautiful Bill Act</strong> (sometimes called the Working Families Tax Cut)
        was signed into law on July 4, 2025. It:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>makes many 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) changes permanent, and</li>
        <li>adds new deductions and credits, especially for working Americans and seniors.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For this guide, the important parts for individual taxpayers are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>“No tax on tips” deduction</strong> – an above-the-line deduction for qualified tip income.</li>
        <li><strong>“No tax on overtime” deduction</strong> – an above-the-line deduction for some overtime pay.</li>
        <li><strong>Car loan interest deduction</strong> – a deduction for interest on certain new car loans.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These rules generally start for the <strong>2025 tax year</strong> (the return you file in
        <strong>2026</strong>) and most run at least through 2026, with some temporary windows (for example,
        car loan interest deduction currently set for 2025–2028, subject to eligibility criteria).
      </p>
      <p>
        The phrase “no tax on” is political branding. In reality these are
        <strong>deductions with caps and income phaseouts</strong>. Used correctly, they can still
        make a big difference to your final tax bill.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2: Tips -->
    <section id="section-2" class="section section-alt">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>2. “No tax on tips” – how the deduction really works</h2>
        <p>
          The OBBB introduces a new deduction targeted at workers who earn tips. It does <em>not</em> mean
          “tips are invisible” – it means you can deduct qualified tips up to a limit, effectively
          cancelling the tax on that part of your income if you qualify.
        </p>

        <div class="table-wrapper">
          <table class="code-table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Feature</th>
                <th>What the law does</th>

                <td>Public summaries describe a cap of up to <strong>$25,000 per taxpayer</strong>, with phaseouts at higher incomes.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Income phaseouts</strong></td>
                <td>Benefit shrinks as income rises.</td>
                <td>Phaseout starts around <strong>$150,000 MAGI</strong> for single and <strong>$300,000</strong> for joint filers, with full phaseout above those levels.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Who qualifies</strong></td>
                <td>Workers in occupations that customarily receive tips.</td>
                <td>IRS lists dozens of occupations (servers, bartenders, salon workers, etc.). Employer reporting rules continue to apply.</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>
          In simple terms: if you earn tips and your income is below the phaseout levels, you may be
          able to deduct a large portion of that tip income so it is effectively not taxed at the
          federal level, subject to caps and other limitations.
        </p>

        <h3>Example – tipped worker in 2025 (filed 2026)</h3>
        <p>
          Suppose you are a server who earns:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>$30,000 in base wages, and</li>
          <li>$20,000 in reported tips.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you qualify for the full “no tax on tips” deduction and your income is below phaseout
          thresholds, up to $20,000 of your tip income could be offset by the deduction (within the
          law’s cap), substantially reducing your taxable income compared with pre-OBBB rules.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3: Overtime -->
    <section id="section-3" class="section container">
      <h2>3. “No tax on overtime” – limits, phaseouts and strategy</h2>
      <p>
        The OBBB also creates a separate deduction for qualified overtime pay. As with tips, it
        focuses on middle-income workers and uses caps and phaseouts.
      </p>

            <tr>
              <td><strong>Income phaseouts</strong></td>
              <td>Same general income thresholds as the tips deduction.</td>
              <td>Phaseout typically begins around <strong>$150,000 MAGI</strong> single / <strong>$300,000</strong> joint.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Who qualifies</strong></td>
              <td>Employees earning overtime wages tracked separately on pay statements.</td>
              <td>Employer reporting and payroll systems may need updates for 2025 as a transition year.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        For many workers who routinely take extra shifts, this deduction can effectively remove
        federal income tax on a sizable part of their overtime wages, within the law’s caps and limits.
      </p>

      <h3>Example – nurse with overtime</h3>
      <p>
        A nurse earns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>$60,000 base salary, and</li>
        <li>$15,000 in overtime pay.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If eligible and under the phaseout threshold, up to $12,500 of that overtime could be
        offset by the “no tax on overtime” deduction, significantly reducing federal tax on those
        extra hours worked.

          The OBBB introduces a new deduction for interest on certain personal auto loans – often
          marketed as “no tax on car loan interest”. It is powerful but far more limited than
          social media suggests.

        <p>
          For those who qualify, the deduction allows you to subtract up to the cap in interest
          from your taxable income, reducing your federal tax bill. It does not reimburse your
          car payment; it lowers tax on the interest portion, up to the annual limit.
        </p>

        <h3>Example – qualifying new car in 2025</h3>
        <p>
          You buy a new U.S.-assembled car in 2025 for personal use, financed with a loan
          that generates $7,500 of interest in 2025. If you meet the income and eligibility
          rules, that $7,500 of interest can potentially be fully deductible under the car
          loan interest deduction for that year.

    <!-- Section 5: Stacking -->
    <section id="section-5" class="section container">
      <h2>5. Stacking OBBB deductions: tips + overtime + car interest</h2>
      <p>
        The real power of the One Big Beautiful Bill comes when you combine multiple provisions.
        A single worker may be able to stack:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“no tax on tips” deduction,</li>
        <li>“no tax on overtime” deduction, and</li>
        <li>car loan interest deduction (if they bought a qualifying vehicle).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Illustrative scenario – tipped worker with overtime and a new car</h3>
      <p>
        Imagine a worker in 2025 (filing in 2026) who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>earns $35,000 in base wages,</li>
        <li>earns $18,000 in tips,</li>
        <li>earns $8,000 in overtime, and</li>
        <li>pays $6,000 in interest on a qualifying new car loan.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If they qualify for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>up to $18,000 of “no tax on tips” deduction (within the cap),</li>
        <li>up to $8,000 (within the overtime cap) of “no tax on overtime” deduction, and</li>
        <li>$6,000 of car loan interest deduction (under the $10,000 cap),</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        then a very large portion of their extra work income and financing cost is shielded from
        federal income tax, on top of the standard deduction and any other credits they qualify for.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exact savings depend on their bracket and credits, but the structure is clear:
        more of their “extra” income can end up in their pocket rather than in federal tax.

    <section id="section-6" class="section section-alt">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>6. Step-by-step checklist for the 2025 tax year (filed 2026)</h2>
        <p>
          Use this simplified plan to capture OBBB benefits on your 2025 tax return:
        </p>

        <ol class="steps-list">
          <li>
            <h3>Step 1 – Confirm your eligibility profile</h3>
            <p>
              For each item, mark “yes” or “no”:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do you earn tip income in an occupation likely to qualify?</li>
              <li>Do you earn overtime wages that are tracked separately on pay stubs?</li>
              <li>Did you take out a qualifying new car loan after Dec. 31, 2024?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Step 2 – Estimate your 2025 Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)</h3>
            <p>
              Estimate total income for 2025 and compare it to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>$150,000 for single filers, or</li>
              <li>$300,000 for married filing jointly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you expect to be well above these levels, the “no tax” deductions may phase out
              or be less valuable. If you are below, the potential benefits are larger.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Step 3 – Track tips, overtime and car interest separately</h3>
            <p>
              Keep:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>year-to-date tip totals (from employer records and your own log),</li>
              <li>year-to-date overtime wage totals, and</li>
              <li>annual interest paid on any qualifying auto loan (from lender statements).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Step 4 – At filing time, use software or a pro that understands OBBB</h3>
            <p>
              When preparing your 2025 return:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>make sure your software is updated for OBBB rules, or</li>
              <li>confirm with your tax preparer that they are applying the tips, overtime and car interest deductions correctly.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Step 5 – Save documentation in case of questions</h3>
            <p>
              Keep copies of:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>pay stubs and employer tip reports,</li>
              <li>year-end wage statements (W-2),</li>
              <li>loan agreements and annual interest summaries for your car, and</li>
              <li>the filed tax return and any worksheets used.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

    <!-- Section 7: Mistakes -->
    <section id="section-7" class="section container">
      <h2>7. Common mistakes, traps and audit risks</h2>
      <p>
        New tax breaks draw attention from both taxpayers and the IRS. The most common problems are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Assuming “all tips are tax-free”</strong> – ignoring caps, job lists and income phaseouts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Claiming overtime that is not correctly classified</strong> – for example, mislabelled bonuses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Car interest on ineligible vehicles</strong> – used cars, leases or vehicles not meeting assembly rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No documentation</strong> – not keeping pay stubs, tip logs or lender statements to support deductions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Relying on social media instead of official guidance</strong> – viral posts often omit limits and conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Being conservative and well-documented is usually the safest way to benefit from OBBB
        while staying off the audit radar.

      <div class="container">
        <h2>8. Adjusting withholding so you feel the benefit sooner</h2>
        <p>
          If you expect OBBB deductions to significantly reduce your tax for 2025, you may want to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>update your Form W-4 with your employer,</li>
          <li>use the IRS withholding estimator (once updated for OBBB rules), and</li>
          <li>avoid over-withholding that simply creates an oversized refund later.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, because 2025 is a transition year and guidance continues to evolve, many people
          prefer to keep withholding slightly higher and treat any OBBB benefit as a refund “bonus”
          rather than risk underpayment penalties.

      <h2>OBBB 2026 tax hacks – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Are my tips completely tax-free under the One Big Beautiful Bill?</h3>
        <p>
          No. The law provides a deduction for qualified tips up to a cap and within income
          limits. Used correctly, it can effectively remove federal tax on a portion of your
          tip income, but it is not an unlimited exemption for all tips.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is all my overtime pay exempt from tax?</h3>
        <p>
          No. The “no tax on overtime” provision creates a deduction up to a dollar limit and
          subject to income phaseouts. Only qualifying overtime wages up to the cap can be
          offset, and high-income taxpayers may see reduced or no benefit.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I deduct interest on any car loan I already have?</h3>
        <p>
          Generally no. The OBBB car loan interest deduction is limited to interest on certain
          new car loans originated after a specified date, for eligible vehicles, with annual
          caps. Used cars and leases usually do not qualify.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I have to itemize to use these OBBB deductions?</h3>
        <p>
          The OBBB “no tax on tips”, “no tax on overtime” and car loan interest rules are designed
          as above-the-line style deductions, so they can apply even if you claim the standard
          deduction rather than itemizing, subject to final IRS guidance.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this OBBB 2026 guide official IRS or tax advice?</h3>
        <p>
          No. This guide summarizes public information and typical interpretations. For personal
          advice, you should consult a qualified tax professional or official IRS publications
          once all implementing guidance is released.
