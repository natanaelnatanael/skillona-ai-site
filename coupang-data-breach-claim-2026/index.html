<h2 id="section1">1. What is the Coupang data breach settlement?</h2>
<p>
  The Coupang data breach settlement resolves consumer lawsuits after a data incident where customer information stored
  by Coupang was accessed by unauthorized third parties. While financial account data is often not included, many consumers
  face risks such as identity theft, scam targeting and unauthorized account access.
</p>
<p>
  Without admitting wrongdoing, Coupang agreed to fund a settlement that provides:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cash reimbursement for documented out-of-pocket losses</li>
  <li>Compensation for time spent dealing with breach-related issues</li>
  <li>Flat cash payments for eligible class members without documentation</li>
  <li>Credit monitoring and identity protection services</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
  <strong>Important:</strong> You generally must submit a claim form to receive any payment. No claim = no payout.
</div>

<h2 id="section2">2. Who is eligible to receive a payment?</h2>
<p>You may be eligible for the Coupang settlement if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You were a Coupang customer during the affected period defined by the settlement</li>
  <li>Your personal information was included in the data incident</li>
  <li>You received a notice letter or email identifying you as a class member</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are unsure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Visit the official settlement website listed in your notice</li>
  <li>Use the claim lookup tool</li>
  <li>Contact the settlement administrator</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section3">3. What can you claim – payout types explained</h2>
<p>The Coupang settlement typically offers three payout categories:</p>

<h3>1) Documented Loss Reimbursement</h3>
<p>
  You may claim reimbursement for money you actually lost due to the breach. Examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unauthorized charges you were held responsible for</li>
  <li>Fees to freeze/unfreeze credit or replace documents</li>
  <li>Identity theft recovery expenses</li>
  <li>Credit monitoring you purchased before the settlement offered it</li>
</ul>

<p>To qualify, you must submit proof such as receipts, statements or invoices.</p>

<h3>2) Time Compensation</h3>
<p>Some settlements allow compensation for time spent addressing breach consequences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hours spent contacting banks or credit bureaus</li>
  <li>Time spent updating passwords and monitoring accounts</li>
  <li>Time dealing with fraudulent activity</li>
</ul>

<p>Time is often compensated at a fixed hourly rate up to a capped number of hours.</p>

<h3>3) Flat Cash Payment (No Proof Required)</h3>
<p>
  If you don’t have documents showing losses, you may still qualify for a flat-tier payment.
  Amount depends on:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>How many people file claims</li>
  <li>The settlement size</li>
  <li>Whether your data was especially sensitive</li>
</ul>

<h3>4) Identity Protection Services</h3>
<p>
  Many breach settlements include free credit monitoring, alerts, and identity restoration support.
</p>

<h2 id="section4">4. Required documentation for higher payouts</h2>
<p>For documented losses, gather:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Receipts</li>
  <li>Bank or card statements</li>
  <li>Invoices</li>
  <li>Emails confirming fraud or account compromise</li>
</ul>

<p>Documents should show:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Date of expense</li>
  <li>Amount paid</li>
  <li>To whom it was paid</li>
  <li>How it relates to the breach</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
  Better documentation = higher payout and faster processing.
</div>

<h2 id="section5">5. How to file your Coupang claim</h2>

<h3>Step 1 — Locate your Claim ID</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Check your email for “Coupang Data Breach Settlement”</li>
  <li>Search physical mail for a postcard notice</li>
  <li>Use the lookup tool on the settlement website</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2 — Decide which payout type you want</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Documented reimbursement</li>
  <li>Time compensation</li>
  <li>Flat no-proof payment</li>
  <li>Credit monitoring</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3 — Submit your claim online (recommended)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Go to the official settlement website</li>
  <li>Click “Submit Claim”</li>
  <li>Enter your Claim ID</li>
  <li>Answer all questions truthfully</li>
  <li>Upload supporting documents if needed</li>
  <li>Submit and save confirmation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 4 — Filing by mail (optional)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Print the claim form</li>
  <li>Complete it clearly</li>
  <li>Attach copies of documents</li>
  <li>Mail via a tracked service</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section6">6. Deadlines you must not miss</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Claim filing deadline</li>
  <li>Opt-out deadline</li>
  <li>Objection deadline</li>
  <li>Final approval hearing</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Exact dates appear in your notice and on the official website.  
  Missing the claim deadline usually means **no payment**.
</p>

<h2 id="section7">7. After filing – what happens next?</h2>
<p>
  The settlement administrator reviews claims and verifies documents. Payments begin only after:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The court grants final approval</li>
  <li>Any appeals end</li>
  <li>Claim auditing is complete</li>
</ul>

<p>Processing can take several months. Updates appear on the official settlement website.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ (2026)</h2>

<h3>Can I file a claim without a Claim ID?</h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Can non-U.S. residents claim?</h3>
<p>
  Most claims are limited to affected customers within the jurisdiction of the lawsuit. Eligibility depends on the class definition.
</p>

<h3>Is this legal advice?</h3>
<p>No. This is an informational guide only.</p>
