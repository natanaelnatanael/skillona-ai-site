  <h2 id="section1">1. What is the AT&amp;T data breach settlement?</h2>
  <p>
    The AT&amp;T data breach settlement is a proposed class action settlement resolving lawsuits over large data incidents
    involving AT&amp;T customer information. In those incidents, personal data of current and former customers was allegedly
    accessed or exposed without authorization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Without admitting wrongdoing, AT&amp;T agreed to a settlement fund and additional benefits to compensate eligible
    customers for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Time spent dealing with the breach</li>
    <li>Out-of-pocket costs, fraud and identity theft losses</li>
    <li>Risks associated with exposed Social Security numbers and other sensitive data</li>
    <li>Credit monitoring and identity protection services</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Important:</strong> You will not receive anything automatically just because you were notified.
    In most cases, you must submit a valid claim form by the deadline to get paid.
  </div>

  <h2 id="section2">2. Who is eligible to claim?</h2>
  <p>
    The settlement defines detailed “Settlement Classes.” In simple terms, you may be eligible if:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are (or were) an AT&amp;T wireless or related customer in the United States, and</li>
    <li>Your personal data was included in one or both of the AT&amp;T data incidents covered by the settlement.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Many people will receive or already received an email or letter from the settlement administrator telling them they are
    likely part of the settlement class. That notice usually includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name and address</li>
    <li>A short description of the incident(s)</li>
    <li>Your unique Claim ID or Confirmation Code</li>
    <li>A link to the official settlement website</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Even if you are not sure, you can usually:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visit the official settlement website listed in your notice</li>
    <li>Use the “Resend Class Member ID” or “Lookup” tool, or</li>
    <li>Call the settlement administrator for confirmation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="section3">3. What can you get – payment types and credit monitoring</h2>
  <p>
    The settlement typically offers several types of benefits. The exact options may depend on which incident affected you
    and what proof you have.
  </p>

  <h3>1) Documented Loss Cash Payment</h3>
  <p>
    If you suffered proven out-of-pocket losses fairly traceable to the data breach (for example, fraud charges, account
    remediation costs, or credit monitoring you purchased yourself), you may be able to submit:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A claim for reimbursement of those losses, up to a maximum cap per person</li>
    <li>Receipts, bank or credit card statements and other proof showing you actually incurred the loss</li>
    <li>A short explanation of how the loss is linked to the AT&amp;T data incident</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2) Flat Tier Cash Payment (no receipts required)</h3>
  <p>
    If you do not have receipts or proof of specific losses, you may still qualify for a smaller, flat cash payment from the
    settlement fund. The exact amount:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Depends on how many people submit valid claims</li>
    <li>May differ based on whether especially sensitive data (like Social Security numbers) was exposed</li>
    <li>Is subject to court approval</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3) Credit monitoring & identity protection</h3>
  <p>
    Many data breach settlements also include free credit monitoring and identity protection services for a set number of
    months. These services may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Credit monitoring at one or more bureaus</li>
    <li>Alerts if new accounts are opened in your name</li>
    <li>Identity theft insurance</li>
    <li>Restoration assistance if your identity is misused</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You can usually choose credit monitoring as an additional benefit even if you also seek a cash payment, but you must
    follow the options described in the official claim form.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section4">4. Key deadlines you must not miss</h2>
  <p>
    Every class action settlement has strict deadlines. For the AT&amp;T data breach settlement, there are usually four main dates:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Claim deadline</strong> – last day to submit your claim form online or by mail</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-out (exclusion) deadline</strong> – last day to remove yourself from the class if you prefer to sue on your own</li>
    <li><strong>Objection deadline</strong> – last day to send an objection to the court about the settlement’s fairness</li>
    <li><strong>Final approval hearing</strong> – the court date where the judge decides whether to approve the settlement</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The exact dates are listed on the official settlement website and in your notice. If you miss the claim deadline:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You will likely receive no payment</li>
    <li>You will still be bound by the settlement if you do nothing</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Action tip:</strong> Put the claim deadline in your calendar and submit your claim well before the last day,
    especially if you are mailing documents.
  </div>

  <h2 id="section5">5. Step-by-step: how to file your AT&amp;T settlement claim</h2>

  <h3>Step 1 – Find your notice and Claim ID</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Search your email for “AT&amp;T Data Incident Settlement” or similar subject lines.</li>
    <li>Check your physical mail for a postcard or letter with a Claim ID.</li>
    <li>If you cannot find it, visit the official settlement website and look for a tool to request your Class Member ID or contact the administrator.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step 2 – Decide what type of claim you will make</h3>
  <p>
    On the claim form, you may be asked whether you are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Requesting reimbursement for documented losses, and/or</li>
    <li>Requesting a flat cash payment from the settlement fund, and/or</li>
    <li>Enrolling in credit monitoring services</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you have receipts or strong proof of fraud, the documented-loss option may be more valuable. If not, you may choose the
    flat-tier payment instead.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3 – Complete the online claim form (fastest)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Go to the official settlement website listed in your notice.</li>
    <li>Click “Submit Claim” or similar.</li>
    <li>Enter your Claim ID and PIN or Confirmation Code, if required.</li>
    <li>Answer all eligibility and incident questions truthfully.</li>
    <li>Upload documents if you are claiming documented losses.</li>
    <li>Review everything carefully and submit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step 4 – Or file by mail (if you prefer paper)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Download the paper claim form from the settlement website or use the one mailed to you.</li>
    <li>Fill it out clearly in pen.</li>
    <li>Attach copies (not originals) of any proof of losses.</li>
    <li>Mail it to the settlement administrator at the address on the form.</li>
    <li>Use certified mail or a trackable service, and keep a copy for your records.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="section6">6. Documents to gather (for higher payouts)</h2>
  <p>
    If you are claiming documented losses, gather:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bank and credit card statements showing fraudulent charges and refunds</li>
    <li>Receipts for credit monitoring or identity theft services you purchased</li>
    <li>Invoices for professional help (e.g., accountant, lawyer) related to the breach</li>
    <li>Proof of time lost or other expenses if the settlement allows “lost time” claims</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Make sure each document:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shows the date</li>
    <li>Shows the amount</li>
    <li>Shows who you paid</li>
    <li>Is reasonably connected to dealing with the data breach or identity theft</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="section7">7. What happens after you file?</h2>
  <p>
    After you submit a claim, the settlement administrator will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Review your answers and documents</li>
    <li>Determine whether your claim is valid under the settlement terms</li>
    <li>Calculate your payment based on the type of claim and the total number of approved claims</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Payments are usually sent only after:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The court grants final approval</li>
    <li>Any appeals are resolved</li>
    <li>The administrator finishes validating claims</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This can take months after the claim deadline, so it is normal not to see money right away. The settlement website
    typically posts updates on timing and payment methods (mailed checks, digital payments or both).
  </p>

  <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (2025–2026)</h2>

  <h3>1. Do I have to pay a lawyer to file my AT&amp;T settlement claim?</h3>
  <p>
    No. You do not have to hire a lawyer to submit a claim form. The settlement administrator and court-approved class
    counsel are already being paid from the settlement fund, and the claim process is designed so that ordinary consumers
    can file on their own.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Will filing a claim affect my relationship with AT&amp;T?</h3>
  <p>
    Filing a claim as a settlement class member should not affect your service. You are simply using rights provided under
    the class action settlement that AT&amp;T agreed to.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Can I sue AT&amp;T separately instead?</h3>
  <p>
    If you want to pursue your own lawsuit, you generally must “opt out” of the settlement by the exclusion deadline.
    If you stay in the settlement class and do nothing, you will usually give up the right to bring your own separate
    lawsuit about the same data incidents, even if you never file a claim.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Is this guide legal advice?</h3>
  <p>
    No. This page is for informational and educational purposes only. It is not legal or tax advice. If you have complex
    losses or questions about your rights, consider speaking with a qualified attorney.
