  <h2 id="section1">1. What are the new IRS crypto reporting requirements for 2026?</h2>
  <p>
    Starting in 2026, the IRS requires all U.S. taxpayers to report all cryptocurrency transactions if they exceed $600
    per year. This includes income from mining, staking, sales of crypto assets, and crypto-to-crypto exchanges.
    Transactions must be reported on Form 1040, Schedule D, and Form 8949, and taxpayers must also report the basis of
    their crypto assets, including the cost of acquisition and the sale proceeds.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section2">2. What digital assets are included in the IRS crypto reporting rules?</h2>
  <p>
    Digital assets subject to reporting include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all cryptocurrencies</li>
    <li>Stablecoins like USDT, USDC</li>
    <li>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</li>
    <li>Any other tokenized digital assets</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The IRS treats all of these assets as property, which means transactions involving them must be reported as capital
    gains or losses, and any income from digital assets must be reported as income.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section3">3. How do I report my crypto transactions?</h2>
  <p>
    Crypto transactions must be reported on your 2026 tax return using:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Form 1040</strong>: The main tax form where all crypto-related income and deductions are reported.</li>
    <li><strong>Schedule D</strong>: For reporting capital gains and losses from crypto sales.</li>
    <li><strong>Form 8949</strong>: For reporting specific sales or exchanges of crypto, including detailed information like purchase
        and sale dates and amounts.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For crypto income such as staking rewards, these must be reported as regular income on the tax return.
  </p>
