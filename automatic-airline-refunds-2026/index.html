      <h2>1. Overview: How the U.S. automatic refund rule works in 2026</h2>
      <p>
        A DOT final rule on airline refunds and other consumer protections became effective in 2024–2025.
        By 2026, airlines operating flights to, from or within the United States must, in general:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          provide <strong>automatic refunds</strong> when a covered flight is cancelled or significantly changed
          and you do not accept the alternative, and
        </li>
        <li>
          refund certain baggage and ancillary fees when the service you paid for is not provided
          or is significantly delayed. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Refunds must be made <strong>back to your original form of payment</strong>, not forced into vouchers,
        except where you clearly choose otherwise. Typical timelines are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>within <strong>7 business days</strong> for credit card purchases, and</li>
        <li>within <strong>20 calendar days</strong> for other payment methods. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Important: Separate proposals for automatic <em>cash compensation</em> for delays (extra money on top
        of refund) have been rolled back or paused. What remains for 2026 is primarily the right to get
        your <strong>money back</strong> when the airline does not deliver the trip or service you paid for. 
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section id="section-2" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>2. When airlines must give automatic refunds in 2026</h2>
      <p>
        Under current DOT rules and guidance, automatic refunds generally apply when <strong>all</strong>
        of the following are true:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>your flight is cancelled or significantly changed/delayed, and</li>
        <li>you are <strong>offered alternatives</strong> (rebooking, credit, voucher), and</li>
        <li>you <strong>do not accept</strong> those alternatives (you choose not to travel), and</li>
        <li>the ticket falls under DOT jurisdiction (flights to, from or within the U.S.). </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.1. Ticket refunds</h3>
      <p>
        You are typically entitled to a refund of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the unused portion of your ticket (fare), and</li>
        <li>taxes and government-imposed fees tied to that segment, and</li>
        <li>certain carrier-imposed surcharges, if they were part of the ticket price.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2. Baggage fee refunds</h3>
      <p>
        If your checked bag is <strong>significantly delayed</strong> beyond set thresholds, airlines must
        refund baggage fees. Thresholds vary slightly, but typical examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>domestic bags delayed more than 12 hours, and</li>
        <li>international bags delayed significantly longer, often 15–30+ hours. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3. Ancillary fee refunds</h3>
      <p>
        When you pay for a specific extra (seat selection, priority boarding, Wi-Fi, pet in cabin, etc.)
        and it is <strong>not provided</strong>, airlines are generally required to refund those fees. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Airlines may try to push vouchers for these amounts, but the default under DOT rules is a
        <strong>cash refund</strong> back to your original payment method.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <section id="section-3" class="section container">
      <h2>3. What counts as a “significant change or delay” in 2026</h2>
      <p>
        The DOT rule specifically defines what a “significant change” or “significant delay” is.
        By 2026, typical triggers include: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Departure or arrival time changes</strong> of at least:
          <ul>
            <li>3 hours for U.S. domestic flights, or</li>
            <li>6 hours for international flights.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Change of airport</strong> (for example, JFK to Newark, or different city airport).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Additional connections</strong> added to your itinerary beyond what you bought.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cabin downgrade</strong> (e.g. business to economy).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Major routing changes</strong> that materially alter your trip.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a change crosses these thresholds and you decide not to travel on the altered itinerary,
        the airline should treat it as a qualifying event for a refund, not just a minor schedule tweak.
      </p>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <section id="section-4" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>4. Step-by-step: How to force a cash refund instead of a voucher</h2>
      <p>
        Airlines often “forget” to clearly mention your right to a refund, or push vouchers and credits.
        Use this playbook to turn a disruption into cash instead of future travel you may never use.
      </p>

      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Step 1 – Confirm your flight qualifies</h3>
          <p>
            Check your situation against DOT criteria:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is your flight to, from or within the U.S.?</li>
            <li>Was it cancelled or significantly changed/delayed under the thresholds above?</li>
            <li>Are you rejecting the alternative routing/credit and choosing not to travel?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 2 – Explicitly state that you are exercising your right to a refund</h3>
          <p>
            Contact the airline through chat, app or phone and use clear wording like:
          </p>
          <p class="quote">
            “Under the U.S. DOT refund rule, my flight has been significantly changed/cancelled,
            I am not accepting the alternative, and I am requesting a full refund back to my
            original form of payment.”
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 3 – Reject vouchers and credits you do not want</h3>
          <p>
            If the agent offers a voucher, answer politely but firmly:
          </p>
          <p class="quote">
            “Thank you, but I am not accepting a voucher. I am requesting the cash refund I am
            entitled to under DOT rules, to the original form of payment.”
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 4 – Keep records of all communication</h3>
          <p>
            Save:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>screenshots of the schedule change or cancellation,</li>
            <li>email notifications,</li>
            <li>chat transcripts and call notes, including dates and agent names.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These are crucial if you escalate to DOT or your credit card issuer later.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 5 – Escalate to a written complaint if necessary</h3>
          <p>
            If the airline refuses or stalls, send a short written complaint through:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the airline’s formal complaint form, and/or</li>
            <li>the DOT’s consumer complaint form (for flights in DOT jurisdiction).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Mention dates, flight numbers, the nature of the change, and that you are requesting
            a refund consistent with DOT rules.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <section id="section-5" class="section container">
      <h2>5. Special situations in 2026 (flight numbers, shutdown chaos, code-share)</h2>
      <p>
        Not every messy situation is handled the same way. Three special cases matter in 2026:
      </p>

      <h3>5.1. Flight renumbering without a real change</h3>
      <p>
        DOT has recently clarified that when a flight is simply re-numbered but operates at
        the same time and in the same way, it will not always be treated as a “cancellation”
        requiring a refund, as long as there is no significant change or delay. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If the only change is the flight number and you still travel on essentially the same
        flight, you may not have a refund right. If timing or routing also change beyond
        thresholds, the usual rules apply.
      </p>

      <h3>5.2. System-wide disruption (shutdowns, ATC cuts, weather chaos)</h3>
      <p>
        Even when the cause is outside the airline’s control, you still have a right to a refund
        if your flight is cancelled or significantly delayed and you decide not to travel.
        What you usually lose in these situations is extra compensation – not your right to get
        your money back. 
      </p>

      <h3>5.3. Code-share and foreign carriers</h3>
      <p>
        If your ticket is sold by a U.S. airline but operated by a foreign carrier (or the reverse),
        jurisdiction can be more complex. Generally, DOT rules cover flights to, from or within
        the U.S. regardless of whether the airline is U.S. or foreign. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is still worth citing DOT rules in your refund request, especially if any segment
        touches U.S. territory.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <section id="section-6" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>6. How long refunds should take – and what to do if they don’t arrive</h2>
      <p>
        DOT guidance expects airlines and ticket agents to process refunds:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>within <strong>7 business days</strong> for credit card purchases, and</li>
        <li>within <strong>20 calendar days</strong> for cash or other payment methods. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If these deadlines pass and you see no refund:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>contact the airline again and quote the timelines above,</li>
        <li>ask for a written confirmation of the refund processing date, and</li>
        <li>if necessary, dispute the charge with your card issuer using your documentation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Credit card chargebacks are not a replacement for DOT rules, but they are often a
        practical backup when airlines delay or ignore refunds.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 7 -->
    <section id="section-7" class="section container">
      <h2>7. Using credit cards, chargebacks and EU261 together with DOT rules</h2>
      <p>
        For some trips you may be protected by multiple layers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>U.S. DOT refund rules for flights to, from or within the U.S.,</li>
        <li>EU261 compensation rules for eligible flights linked to the EU/EEA, and</li>
        <li>your card issuer’s dispute and travel protections.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Typical order of attack:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, use DOT-based refund rights to get your money back when the flight is cancelled or heavily changed.</li>
        <li>Then, if the disruption meets EU261 criteria (for qualifying EU flights), pursue compensation on top of the refund.</li>
        <li>Use credit card protections if the airline refuses or significantly delays paying what you are owed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Knowing all three systems lets you stack protections legally, rather than accepting the first voucher offered.

      <h2>Automatic airline refunds 2026 – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I always get an automatic refund when my flight is delayed?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Refund rights usually apply when your flight is cancelled or significantly changed
          beyond DOT thresholds and you choose not to travel. Small schedule shifts or minor
          delays typically do not trigger a refund right on their own.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can airlines force me to take a voucher instead of cash?</h3>
        <p>
          Under DOT rules, airlines generally must provide refunds back to your original form
          of payment when you qualify. You can choose a voucher if it suits you, but you do
          not have to accept one instead of a refund.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do these rules apply to foreign airlines?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, if the flight is to, from or within the United States, DOT rules generally apply
          regardless of whether the carrier is U.S. or foreign. For purely non-U.S. routes,
          local laws (such as EU261) may apply instead.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I get both a refund and EU261 compensation?</h3>
        <p>
          In many cases, yes. The refund returns the price of a trip you did not take. EU261
          compensation is an additional payment for certain disruptions under EU law. Whether
          both apply depends on your exact itinerary and circumstances.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this 2026 airline refund guide official legal advice?</h3>
        <p>
          No. This guide summarizes public rules and common patterns. For formal legal advice,
          you should consult a lawyer or consumer advocate who focuses on aviation rights.
