      <h1>SBA Loan Personal Guarantee Release 2026 – How to Remove or Reduce Your PG Liability</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Most SBA 7(a) and 504 borrowers think a personal guarantee (PG) is permanent.  
        In reality, lenders can remove, reduce or restructure your PG after certain milestones –
        but only if you know how to ask, what financial ratios they require, and which documents
        trigger a formal review. This 2026 guide shows you exactly when a PG can be released and how
        to request it the right way.

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <section id="section-1" class="section container">
      <h2>1. How personal guarantees work for SBA loans in 2026</h2>
      <p>
        SBA requires lenders to take personal guarantees from owners with 20%+ ownership.  
        The PG makes you personally liable if the business defaults – meaning the lender can pursue
        personal assets if the business cannot repay.
      </p>
      <p>
        But SBA rules also give lenders discretion to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>release the PG,</li>
        <li>reduce the PG,</li>
        <li>substitute collateral instead of a PG,</li>
        <li>update the loan structure after strong performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Few borrowers know this, so lenders rarely mention it unless you ask.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section id="section-2" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>2. When lenders actually consider PG release</h2>
      <p>These real-world triggers often qualify you for PG reconsideration:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>At least 24–36 months of perfect on-time payments.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.25–1.40+ for 2 years.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Healthy business financials:</strong> stable revenue, profitability, clean tax returns.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong business credit profile.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Low utilization of credit lines.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Business assets sufficient to cover remaining loan balance.</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Lenders want proof the business can stand on its own without relying on your personal guarantee.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <section id="section-3" class="section container">
      <h2>3. Financial ratios lenders look for in 2026</h2>
      <p>These ratios matter most in PG release decisions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DSCR:</strong> 1.25–1.40+ (strong ability to service debt).</li>
        <li><strong>EBITDA margin:</strong> stable or improving year over year.</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage ratio:</strong> decreasing trend, healthier balance sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> adequate operating cash and reserves.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If these numbers are trending upward for 2–3 years, lenders are much more open to removing your PG.

      <h2>4. Step-by-step: How to request a PG release</h2>

      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Step 1 – Prepare a financial package</h3>
          <p>Include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>last 2–3 years business tax returns,</li>
            <li>year-to-date financials,</li>
            <li>profit & loss statements,</li>
            <li>balance sheet,</li>
            <li>cash flow statement,</li>
            <li>updated business plan (optional but powerful).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 2 – Draft the PG Release Request Letter</h3>
          <p>State:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>your payment history,</li>
            <li>financial strength indicators,</li>
            <li>collateral improvements,</li>
            <li>why the business no longer needs a PG.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 3 – Submit to the lender’s SBA servicing department</h3>
          <p>
            PG release requests are handled by the **servicing** team,  
            not loan officers or underwriting.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 4 – Follow up with formal documentation</h3>
          <p>
            Lenders may request:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>updated financial statements,</li>
            <li>business credit reports,</li>
            <li>new collateral valuations,</li>
            <li>tax transcripts.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 5 – Negotiate alternatives if full release is denied</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>partial PG reduction,</li>
            <li>substitution of collateral,</li>
            <li>PG release after additional 12–18 months of performance.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        Even in 2026, you cannot get PG release if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the business is losing money or has unstable cash flow,</li>
        <li>you are behind on payments,</li>

        <li>loan balance is too high relative to business assets,</li>
        <li>you applied recently (first 24 months).</li>

        Some lenders also have stricter internal rules than SBA minimum guidelines.

      <h2>7. Alternatives to PG removal</h2>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Refinance with a non-SBA lender:</strong> often removes PG entirely if business is strong.</li>
        <li><strong>Refinance with SBA again:</strong> sometimes new lenders offer better PG terms.</li>
