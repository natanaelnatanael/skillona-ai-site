  <h2 id="section1">1. What are the new short-term rental bans and regulations for 2026?</h2>
  <p>
    In 2026, several U.S. cities and counties have implemented or updated regulations for short-term rentals like Airbnb and VRBO.
    Some areas have introduced outright bans on short-term rentals, while others require hosts to register or obtain permits.
    The regulations vary greatly depending on the region, with some cities opting to allow more freedom while others tighten controls
    to address housing shortages and neighborhood concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
    **Key Regulations:**
    <ul>
      <li>Some cities have implemented outright bans on short-term rentals to address housing shortages.</li>
      <li>Other cities have introduced registration requirements for hosts to collect taxes and monitor short-term rental activity.</li>
      <li>Some counties provide options for local governments to opt-out of these regulations, giving more flexibility to rural or less populated areas.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 id="section2">2. How will short-term rental bans impact Airbnb and VRBO hosts?</h2>
  <p>
    Hosts will be affected differently depending on their location. In cities with bans or strict regulations, hosts may be forced to
    cease operations or pay hefty fines. In areas with less restrictive rules, hosts may simply need to register and comply with
    reporting requirements. The key is staying informed about local regulations to avoid penalties and maximize rental opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
    **Impact on Hosts:**
    <ul>
      <li>Hosts in cities with bans may need to cancel bookings or face penalties for non-compliance.</li>
      <li>In areas with registration or opt-out laws, hosts may need to pay for permits or taxes on short-term rental income.</li>
      <li>Hosts should track changes in regulations to remain compliant and avoid lost income.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 id="section3">3. Can counties opt out of short-term rental regulations?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, many counties have the option to opt out of certain short-term rental restrictions. This flexibility allows local governments
    to decide whether to enforce specific policies like registration, taxes, or limitations on the number of rentals allowed per
    year. In areas with opt-out provisions, the laws may vary significantly even within the same state.
  </p>
  <p>
    **County Opt-Out:**
    <ul>
      <li>Counties can choose to enforce or opt-out of regulations based on their local needs.</li>
      <li>Some rural or less populated areas may avoid restrictions to encourage tourism or additional income for homeowners.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
