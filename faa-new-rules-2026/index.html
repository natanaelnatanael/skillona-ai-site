<p>
  FAA’s 2026 regulatory package focuses on passenger safety, transparency, and accountability. Several high-profile airline incidents prompted Congress and the FAA to enforce clearer rules on baggage, delays, safety inspections, and drone identification systems.
</p>

<p><strong>Core 2026 updates:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Standardized carry-on enforcement across all major airlines</li>
  <li>Mandatory delay/cancellation disclosures before ticket purchase</li>
  <li>Stricter drone airspace limits & Remote ID enforcement</li>
  <li>New pilot training modules focused on automation monitoring</li>

  <strong>2026 summary:</strong> FAA is tightening safety rules, increasing airline accountability, and modernizing drone oversight to reduce accidents and protect passengers.
</div>

<h2 id="section2">2. New 2026 Carry-On & Baggage Enforcement Rules</h2>
<p>
  FAA now requires airlines to use a <strong>standardized carry-on sizing template</strong> for all carriers flying within the U.S. This ends years of inconsistency between airlines.
</p>

<h3>Main 2026 baggage changes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All airlines must list size limits clearly at the time of purchase.</li>
  <li>No hidden “gate-check fees” allowed unless published upfront.</li>
  <li>Overhead-bin space must match the aircraft model’s certified capacity.</li>
  <li>New penalties for airlines that misclassify carry-ons as oversized.</li>
</ul>

<h3>For passengers:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fewer surprise fees at the gate</li>
  <li>Greater predictability across airlines</li>
  <li>Mandatory measuring devices at boarding gates</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section3">3. Passenger Rights: Delays, Cancellations & Compensation</h2>
<p>
  Although the U.S. does not adopt EU-style cash compensation, FAA’s 2026 rules strengthen what airlines must provide.
</p>

<p><strong>New 2026 requirements include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Mandatory refunds for cancellations regardless of airline credit policies</li>
  <li>Meal vouchers for delays exceeding 3 hours</li>
  <li>Hotel accommodations for overnight delays caused by airline fault</li>
  <li>Real-time flight status transparency on website and app</li>
</ul>

<p>
  FAA will also require airlines to show <strong>historical delay probability</strong> during the booking process.
</p>

<h2 id="section4">4. Drone Regulation Updates (Remote ID & Airspace Rules)</h2>
<p>
  2026 is a major year for drone operators as FAA completes its final Remote ID rollout.
</p>

<h3>New rules include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All drones (recreational + commercial) must broadcast Remote ID</li>
  <li>Expanded restricted zones near airports, federal buildings, and schools</li>
  <li>Mandatory certification for commercial drone pilots under updated Part 107</li>
  <li>New training modules covering autonomous flight systems</li>
</ul>

<p>
  FAA also strengthened penalties for unauthorized flights in controlled airspace.
</p>

<h2 id="section5">5. Pilot Certification & Training Updates</h2>
<p>
  Several incidents tied to cockpit automation prompted FAA to require:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enhanced manual flight proficiency checks</li>
  <li>Updated automation dependency evaluations</li>
  <li>More simulator hours focused on rare emergency scenarios</li>
  <li>Required mental health monitoring support programs</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Airlines must verify compliance annually through new FAA audits.
</p>

<h2 id="section6">6. Aircraft Maintenance & Safety Inspection Changes</h2>
<p>
  FAA expanded inspection requirements for aging fleets and regional aircraft.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>New corrosion testing standards</li>
  <li>More frequent inspection intervals</li>
  <li>Stricter documentation requirements for deferred maintenance items</li>
  <li>Mandatory digital logs submitted to FAA for certain aircraft types</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Airlines failing to meet inspection timelines face automatic grounding of affected aircraft.
</p>

<h2 id="section7">7. Airline Compliance, Fines & Consumer Transparency</h2>
<p>
  FAA increased penalties for regulatory violations, especially involving passenger deception or safety shortcuts.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Higher fines for misleading baggage or refund policies</li>
  <li>Penalties for failing to display all mandatory fare components</li>
  <li>Stricter enforcement of tarmac delay rules</li>
  <li>Mandatory reporting of internal safety issues</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Airlines must now publish a quarterly compliance summary accessible to consumers.
</p>
