<h1>TikTok Shop Seller Policy Changes 2026 – Full Guide</h1>

<img src="/images/tiktok-shop-policy-2026.webp" alt="TikTok Shop policy changes 2026 cover image" />

<p>
TikTok Shop enters 2026 with its biggest wave of seller-policy changes so far. 
These updates focus on faster fulfillment, cleaner product listings, transparent pricing, 
reduced misleading content, and a new seller-risk scoring system that affects visibility, 
traffic, payouts and long-term account health.
</p>

<h2>1. Stricter Seller Identity Verification (KYC Expansion)</h2>
<p>
TikTok significantly expands identity and business verification checks in 2026. 
The platform now requires additional documents for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Foreign-owned businesses</li>
  <li>New sellers with rapid sales spikes</li>
  <li>Sellers in “high-risk” categories (beauty, electronics, supplements)</li>
  <li>Accounts with mismatched business names vs payment information</li>
</ul>
<p>
Failure to pass KYC leads to payout freezes, restricted listing ability or full account deactivation.
</p>

<h2>2. New 2026 Listing Rules (Claims, Transparency & Prohibited Content)</h2>
<p>
TikTok tightens product-listing requirements to reduce misleading claims. 
Sellers must avoid:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unverified performance claims (“10x stronger”, “clinically proven” without proof)</li>
  <li>Medical-style promises (weight loss, skin curing, hair regrowth)</li>
  <li>Hidden fees or drip pricing</li>
  <li>Misleading before-and-after images</li>
</ul>
<p>
Listings that violate the updated 2026 rule set may be removed automatically by platform filters, 
often without manual review.
</p>

<h2>3. 2026 Category Fee Changes (Small but Important)</h2>
<p>Some categories experience commission modifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Beauty & skincare: slight fee increase</li>
  <li>Electronics & gadgets: new risk-based fee modifier</li>
  <li>High-complaint products: added “risk surcharge” fee</li>
</ul>
<p>
TikTok introduces a refund-ratio adjustment that raises or lowers fees depending on the seller’s performance.
</p>

<h2>4. Faster Fulfillment Rules (Strict 2026 Timelines)</h2>
<p>
Shipping delays are now one of the top triggers for seller demotions. The 2026 rules require:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tracking uploaded within 24 hours</li>
  <li>Package movement within 48 hours</li>
  <li>Late dispatch ratio kept near 0–2%</li>
</ul>
<p>
Repeated violations automatically reduce your product visibility across the For You feed.
</p>

<h2>5. New Seller Risk Score (Core Update for 2026)</h2>
<p>
TikTok introduces a real-time risk-rating system similar to Stripe, Amazon and eBay.
Factors include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complaint and dispute ratio</li>
  <li>Refund-request frequency</li>
  <li>Late shipping rate</li>
  <li>Misleading content flags</li>
  <li>Listing accuracy score</li>
</ul>
<p>
A low score reduces impressions and may freeze payouts.
</p>

<h2>6. Expanded Refund & Return Rights (Consumer-Focused Update)</h2>
<p>
TikTok now requires sellers to honor:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Longer return windows for several categories</li>
  <li>Automatic refunds on “not as described” claims if evidence is strong</li>
  <li>Faster dispute responses (24–48 hours)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Sellers who ignore dispute deadlines risk penalties applied across the entire account—not only the product.
</p>

<h2>7. Proactive Enforcement & AI Scanning</h2>
<p>
TikTok’s automated compliance system becomes more aggressive in 2026. 
It now scans:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Video content</li>
  <li>Captions and text overlays</li>
  <li>Product images</li>
  <li>Customer reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>
AI flags any mismatch between the video demonstration and the product listing description.
</p>

<h2>8. How to Protect Your Account in 2026</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use plain, accurate product descriptions</li>
  <li>Upload tracking immediately</li>
  <li>Respond to customer messages within 24 hours</li>
  <li>Stay below 2–3% dispute ratio</li>
  <li>Avoid exaggerated claims in videos</li>
  <li>Regularly monitor seller dashboard warnings</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. When to Appeal Decisions</h2>
<p>
You should file an appeal when:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A listing is removed incorrectly</li>
  <li>A customer claim is obviously fraudulent</li>
  <li>Your risk score drops due to shipping carrier issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Appeals work best with screenshots, timestamps and clear documentation.</p>
