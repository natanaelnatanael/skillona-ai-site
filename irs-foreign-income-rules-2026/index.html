  </div>

  <h2 id="section1">1. Who is affected by the 2026 foreign income rules?</h2>
  <p>
    The 2026 foreign income rules mainly target three groups of U.S. taxpayers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>U.S. citizens and residents working abroad</strong> with foreign salary, freelance income or self-employment income.</li>
    <li><strong>Americans who own or control foreign companies</strong> – especially controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) and some
        foreign funds treated as PFICs.</li>
    <li><strong>U.S. taxpayers with foreign investment income</strong> and foreign taxes that may qualify for the foreign tax credit.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) did not create a brand-new tax on foreign income, but it modified and tightened
    several existing international tax rules and triggered fresh IRS guidance for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How foreign taxes are allocated for foreign tax credit purposes, after the repeal of the “one-month deferral” rule.</li>
    <li>How some CFC dividends and previously taxed earnings are treated for U.S. shareholders.</li>
    <li>Priority guidance projects that will further refine international rules over 2025–2026.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>Quick test – you should pay attention to 2026 foreign income rules if:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You live outside the U.S. but still file a U.S. tax return.</li>
      <li>You own shares in a non-U.S. company you control (even a small operating company or holding company).</li>
      <li>You pay foreign tax and want to avoid double taxation using the FEIE or foreign tax credit.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 id="section2">2. Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) & foreign tax credit basics</h2>
  <p>
    For 2026, the <strong>Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)</strong> increases to <strong>$132,900</strong> per qualifying taxpayer,
    according to IRS inflation adjustment guidance.
  </p>
  <p>Key points:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Applies only to <strong>earned income</strong> (wages, freelance, self-employment) from services performed abroad.</li>
    <li>You must pass either the <strong>physical presence test</strong> or the <strong>bona fide residence test</strong>.</li>
    <li>You still need to file a U.S. return and usually Form 2555 to claim it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In many cases you also deal with the <strong>Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)</strong>, claimed on Form 1116. Final foreign tax credit
    regulations and draft instructions for Form 1116 continue to apply in 2026, with important reminders:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The FTC only applies to properly creditable foreign taxes.</li>
    <li>There are separate “baskets” for different types of income.</li>
    <li>There is a time limit for when a credit or deduction can be claimed for foreign taxes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>FEIE vs. foreign tax credit – simple positioning:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>FEIE reduces the <strong>amount of foreign earned income</strong> included in U.S. taxable income.</li>
    <li>Foreign tax credit reduces the <strong>U.S. tax due</strong> on foreign-source income by the amount of foreign tax paid, subject
        to limits.</li>
    <li>Many Americans abroad use a <strong>combination</strong> – FEIE for salary and FTC for additional income or where foreign tax
        is high.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>2026 planning idea:</strong> If you pay high foreign tax and own a foreign company, it may be more efficient to rely on
    the foreign tax credit (and possibly high-tax exception elections) instead of pushing everything under the FEIE. This is
    highly fact-specific – get advice before changing strategy.
  </div>

  <h2 id="section3">3. New IRS international guidance for foreign companies (CFCs, GILTI, tax credits)</h2>
  <p>
    In late 2025, the IRS released a series of notices giving early guidance on international tax changes under OBBB.
  </p>
  <p>The details are technical, but the practical impact for U.S. owners of foreign companies in 2026 includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>End of the one-month deferral election</strong> for many foreign corporations.
      <ul>
        <li>Many foreign corporations must align their year-end with the majority U.S. shareholder year-end.</li>
        <li>There may be a short “transition year” where foreign taxes must be allocated between two periods.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Revised treatment of certain CFC dividends and previously taxed earnings</strong>.
      <ul>
        <li>New rules affect how some distributions tied to GILTI and Subpart F inclusions are treated in U.S. taxable
            income.</li>
        <li>There is a partial disallowance of foreign tax credits in some cases tied to previously taxed earnings.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Interaction with GILTI starting in 2026.</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The GILTI deduction percentage for corporations is scheduled to change, which effectively increases the U.S.
            rate on GILTI inclusions unless planning is done.</li>
        <li>FTC limitations and high-tax exception elections become more valuable for some structures.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    IRS and Treasury also included multiple international items in the 2025–2026 Priority Guidance Plan, signaling that
    more detailed regulations and examples are coming.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <strong>What this means if you own a foreign company in 2026:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Year-end changes and transition rules can shift when income and foreign taxes are recognized.</li>
      <li>Incorrect handling may cost you foreign tax credits or increase GILTI/Subpart F inclusions.</li>
      <li>A basic “set-and-forget” structure may no longer be safe – especially for CFCs with significant profits or foreign taxes.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 id="section4">4. 2026 checklist for U.S. taxpayers with foreign income or entities</h2>
  <p>
    Use this simple checklist as a starting point if you have foreign income, accounts or companies in 2026. It is not a
    substitute for individual advice, but it helps you ask the right questions.
  </p>

  <h3>A. If you work or freelance abroad (no foreign company)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm whether you qualify for the FEIE in 2026 (physical presence or bona fide residence).</li>
    <li>Estimate total foreign earned income vs. the $132,900 exclusion per person.</li>
    <li>Check which foreign taxes you pay and whether you should also claim the foreign tax credit.</li>
    <li>List all foreign bank and investment accounts to see if FBAR/Form 8938 applies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>B. If you own a foreign corporation (CFC or similar)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify whether the company is a <strong>controlled foreign corporation (CFC)</strong> based on U.S. ownership.</li>
    <li>Review:
      <ul>
        <li>Retained earnings and profits</li>
        <li>Foreign taxes paid or accrued</li>
        <li>Distributions to you during the year</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Check if the company previously used a one-month deferral and whether a short “transition year” applies.</li>
    <li>Work with a professional to:
      <ul>
        <li>Model GILTI, Subpart F and any high-tax exception elections.</li>
        <li>Apply foreign tax credit rules under the new allocation guidance.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Confirm all required forms (for example, Form 5471, Form 8938) are filed correctly and on time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>C. If you invest through foreign funds or platforms</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Determine whether any holdings may be treated as PFICs under U.S. rules.</li>
    <li>Review brokerage or platform statements for:
      <ul>
        <li>Foreign dividends</li>
        <li>Capital gains</li>
        <li>Foreign taxes withheld</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Coordinate PFIC reporting, foreign tax credit and GILTI/Subpart F exposure where relevant.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>D. Questions to ask a tax professional in 2026</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>“Is my foreign structure still tax-efficient after the new OBBB international guidance?”</li>
    <li>“Should I rely more on FEIE, the foreign tax credit or a mix of both?”</li>
    <li>“Do year-end or transition rules affect my foreign company’s income and foreign tax credits?”</li>
    <li>“Do I qualify for any elections that reduce GILTI or avoid double taxation?”</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- FAQ SECTION -->
  <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (2026)</h2>

  <h3>1. Who is affected by the 2026 IRS rules on foreign income?</h3>
  <p>
    The 2026 rules mainly affect U.S. citizens and residents with foreign salary or self-employment income, Americans
    abroad claiming the FEIE or foreign tax credit, and U.S. owners of foreign companies that count as CFCs or similar
    entities. If you are a U.S. person with foreign accounts, investments or a foreign business, you should assume the new
    guidance could touch you and get a review.
  </p>

  <h3>2. What is the foreign earned income exclusion amount for 2026?</h3>
  <p>
    For tax year 2026, the foreign earned income exclusion is <strong>$132,900</strong> per qualifying taxpayer. If both spouses qualify
    and meet the tests, they may each claim the exclusion on separate earned income, subject to normal rules.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Do I still need to file if my foreign income is below the FEIE?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. The FEIE is claimed on a filed U.S. tax return – it is not automatic. You must usually file Form 1040 and Form
    2555 to elect it, and you may still have separate reporting duties such as FBAR, Form 8938 or forms for foreign
    entities and trusts, even if no U.S. income tax is ultimately due.
  </p>

  <h3>4. How do the new rules affect my foreign company?</h3>
  <p>
    If your foreign company is a CFC, you may be affected by year-end changes, new rules on how foreign taxes are allocated,
    restrictions on foreign tax credits for certain distributions and the effective rate on GILTI from 2026 onward. A
    modeling exercise with a professional is usually needed to see the net impact.
  </p>

  <h3>5. What if I have both U.S. and foreign companies plus personal foreign income?</h3>
  <p>
    In that situation, you are combining three different systems: U.S. individual rules, U.S. corporate and CFC rules, and
    the tax rules of the foreign country. The FEIE and foreign tax credit are only part of the picture. For 2026 and
    beyond, it is usually worth treating this as a full structure review – entity by entity – instead of simply repeating
    the same filing pattern as prior years.
