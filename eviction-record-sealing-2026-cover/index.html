  <h2 id="section1">1. What is Eviction Record Sealing in 2026?</h2>
  <p>
    Eviction record sealing is a legal process that allows individuals who have been evicted to have their eviction record removed from public access. In 2026, more states are implementing or expanding the ability to seal eviction records, which will help people move forward and secure housing without the stigma of an eviction on their record.
  </p>
  <p>
    **Why Seal Your Eviction Record?**
    <ul>
      <li>Improves your chances of getting approved for future rental applications.</li>
      <li>Clears your eviction history from background checks.</li>
      <li>Helps you regain your credibility as a tenant and renter.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2 id="section2">2. Who is Eligible to Seal Their Eviction Record?</h2>
  <p>
    Eligibility for eviction record sealing varies by state and locality. Typically, individuals who have been evicted but have complied with all legal requirements (such as paying any outstanding balances or settling disputes) may be eligible. In some areas, there may be a waiting period before a record can be sealed, while others require that the eviction was resolved favorably for the tenant.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section3">3. How to Seal Your Eviction Record</h2>
  <p>
    The process for sealing an eviction record involves filing a petition with the court or relevant local authority. The petition must include supporting documentation, such as proof that you meet eligibility criteria. Some jurisdictions may require a legal review or a court hearing before granting the sealing request.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section4">4. How Sealing an Eviction Record Helps with Rental Applications</h2>
  <p>
    Sealing your eviction record means that landlords will not be able to access your eviction history when performing background checks. This can significantly improve your chances of being approved for a rental property, as many landlords use eviction records as a red flag when evaluating potential tenants.
  </p>
