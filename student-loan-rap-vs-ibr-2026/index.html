      <h1>Student Loan RAP vs IBR in 2026 – Avoid Paying 700% More by Picking the Right Plan</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        A new income-driven student loan plan – the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) – is scheduled to
        replace or reshape older plans like IBR and PAYE. For many low and middle income borrowers,
        choosing the wrong plan could mean paying several times more over the life of the loan.
        This guide explains, in simple terms, how RAP compares to IBR in 2026 and how to choose the
        lowest-cost strategy for your situation.

      <h2>1. What the new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) is</h2>
      <p>
        The U.S. Department of Education has proposed a new income-driven repayment plan called the
        <strong>Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP)</strong>. It is intended to replace or consolidate several older
        IDR options while reducing certain subsidies that made earlier plans extremely generous for
        some borrowers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key ideas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>RAP is still an <strong>income-driven plan</strong> – your payment is tied to your income and family size.</li>
        <li>It uses a revised formula for what counts as “discretionary income”.</li>
        <li>It sets different percentages and timelines for undergraduate vs graduate debt.</li>
        <li>It is designed to make <strong>very low-income borrowers</strong> more clearly eligible for zero or very small payments, but can increase lifetime payments for some others compared with the most generous current plans.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The plan is expected to become available to borrowers in or around <strong>mid-2026</strong>, with details
        finalized in federal regulations beforehand.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section id="section-2" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>2. Quick refresher on IBR and other IDR plans</h2>
      <p>
        Before RAP, most borrowers had access to several income-driven plans, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>IBR (Income-Based Repayment)</strong> – classic IDR with 10–15% of discretionary income and 20–25 year forgiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>PAYE (Pay As You Earn)</strong> – 10% of discretionary income, 20-year forgiveness for many undergrads.</li>
        <li><strong>REPAYE/SAVE</strong> – newer plan with interest subsidies and lower payments for some borrowers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All of these plans:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>define <em>discretionary income</em> as income above a multiple of the poverty line,</li>
        <li>charge a percentage of that discretionary income as your monthly payment,</li>
        <li>offer eventual forgiveness after a set number of years of qualifying payments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The problem is complexity: many borrowers are in suboptimal plans, or think they cannot afford
        payments when a better IDR would help. RAP is meant to simplify—but also to tighten up some of
        the most expensive subsidies.

      <h2>3. How RAP calculates monthly payments in 2026</h2>
      <p>
        Exact RAP regulations are still being finalized, but the general structure looks like this:
      </p>

      <div class="table-wrapper">
        <table class="code-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Feature</th>
              <th>RAP (proposed)</th>
              <th>Typical IBR / older IDR</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Discretionary income</strong></td>
              <td>Adjusted gross income above a set multiple of the poverty line (e.g. 225% or similar, subject to final rule).</td>
              <td>Often 150%–225% of poverty line depending on the plan.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Payment percentage (undergrad debt)</strong></td>
              <td>Lower % of discretionary income than older IBR for genuinely low incomes; can rise with income tiers.</td>
              <td>10% or 15% of discretionary income, depending on IBR version.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Payment percentage (grad debt)</strong></td>
              <td>Generally higher than for undergrad-only borrowers.</td>
              <td>Same or slightly higher percentage, with fewer interest subsidies.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Forgiveness timeline</strong></td>
              <td>Longer timelines for larger loan balances; standard 20–25 years for many borrowers.</td>
              <td>20–25 years depending on debt type and plan.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Interest treatment</strong></td>
              <td>Reduced interest subsidies compared with SAVE; unpaid interest may accumulate more aggressively.</td>
              <td>Some plans cap interest growth or subsidize part of it; others allow capitalization.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        In plain English: RAP can <strong>lower monthly payments</strong> for some lower-income borrowers, but if the
        interest subsidies are weaker and forgiveness timelines are longer, the <strong>total amount paid over decades</strong>
        can be much higher than under the most generous existing plan for the same person.
      </p>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <section id="section-4" class="section section-alt container">
      <h2>4. Who pays more under RAP vs IBR – real borrower profiles</h2>
      <p>
        The scariest numbers in RAP discussions come from modelling of different borrower types.
        Some analyses show that for certain profiles, RAP-style rules can increase total
        payments dramatically compared to current IBR/SAVE baselines.
      </p>

      <h3>4.1 Low-income, modest-debt borrowers</h3>
      <p>
        Example: single borrower, $25,000 undergraduate debt, income hovering around 150–200% of poverty.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>RAP is likely to be <strong>similar or better</strong> than older IDR plans.</li>
        <li>Payments may be very low or zero in low-income years.</li>
        <li>Forgiveness timeline is manageable and interest less of a long-term issue.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.2 Middle-income, high-debt borrowers</h3>
      <p>
        Example: borrower with $90,000 in combined undergrad + grad loans, income growing from $40,000 to $80,000+ over time.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>RAP can initially offer lower payments than a standard 10-year plan, easing early cashflow.</li>
        <li>But weaker interest subsidies and long timelines mean <strong>much more interest accumulates</strong>.</li>
        <li>Compared to the most generous 10% IDR with strong subsidies, some borrowers can end up paying several times more over the full term if they stay in RAP and never aggressively pay down principal.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.3 “700% more” risk</h3>
      <p>
        Where do the “700% more” headlines come from? From extreme scenarios where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a borrower has very high grad-school debt (six figures),</li>
        <li>stays on a slow, stretched-out IDR plan for decades,</li>
        <li>and pays less up front but lets interest compound for a long time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In those cases, lifetime payments under a tighter plan like RAP can be many multiples of what <strong>could</strong>
        have been paid under a different strategy (e.g. refinancing plus aggressive paydown or a more subsidized IDR).
        Not everyone will see this effect – but the risk is real for the wrong borrower on the wrong plan.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <section id="section-5" class="section container">
      <h2>5. Interest growth, forgiveness timelines and “700% more” risk</h2>
      <p>
        To understand the danger, you need to separate three things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Monthly payment amount now</strong> – what you feel in your budget today.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest growth</strong> – how quickly your balance grows or shrinks over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Total paid before forgiveness</strong> – the real lifetime cost.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.1 Lower payment & weak subsidies = slow drowning</h3>
      <p>
        If RAP sets your payment so low that it does not cover accruing interest, and there is little or no
        subsidy, your <strong>balance can grow</strong> for years even while you are “in good standing”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over 20–25 years, that can turn a manageable principal into a huge total amount paid if you stay
        on the plan and never aggressively reduce principal. This is where modelling shows very large
        multiples vs more generous subsidies.
      </p>

      <h3>5.2 Forgiveness is not always free</h3>
      <p>
        Under current rules, forgiveness after 20–25 years can be treated as taxable income in some future years
        unless Congress extends or changes tax relief. That means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>you could face a <strong>tax bill</strong> on the forgiven amount,</li>
        <li>unless future legislation keeps forgiven student debt tax-free.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        RAP does not magically remove this issue; it simply changes the path you take to forgiveness.

      <h2>6. Checklist: How to choose between RAP and IBR</h2>
      <p>
        Use this decision framework before RAP takes effect:
      </p>

      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Step 1 – Classify yourself: low, middle or high debt vs income</h3>
          <p>
            Roughly:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Low-debt: total loans less than your annual income.</li>
            <li>Medium-debt: total loans 1–2× your annual income.</li>
            <li>High-debt: total loans more than 2× your annual income.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 2 – Decide your real goal</h3>
          <p>
            Be honest:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is your priority <strong>lowest payment now</strong> no matter the long-term cost?</li>
            <li>Or <strong>lowest total paid</strong> over the life of the loan?</li>
            <li>Or <strong>maximizing forgiveness</strong> under IDR and PSLF rules?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 3 – Compare monthly payment estimates</h3>
          <p>
            Use the official federal loan simulator (once updated for RAP) to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>compare RAP vs IBR vs other IDR for your income, family size and debt,</li>
            <li>note the <strong>monthly payment</strong> in each plan,</li>
            <li>note the <strong>projected total paid</strong> over time and any forgiveness.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 4 – Watch for red flags</h3>
          <p>
            Be very cautious if:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>RAP payment is only slightly lower than IBR, but total paid is much higher.</li>
            <li>RAP projections show your balance <strong>growing</strong> for many years.</li>
            <li>you are high-debt, middle-income, and RAP pushes forgiveness far into the future.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 5 – Consider a hybrid strategy</h3>
          <p>
            For some borrowers, it may make sense to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>use RAP briefly during low-income years to stay current, then</li>
            <li>switch to a different plan or more aggressive payoff once income rises.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

    <!-- Section 7 -->
    <section id="section-7" class="section container">
      <h2>7. Step-by-step: What to do before RAP takes effect</h2>
      <p>
        A simple pre-RAP action plan:
      </p>
      <ol class="steps-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Step 1 – Download your full loan data</h3>
          <p>
            From studentaid.gov or your servicer, export or save:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>loan types (Direct, FFEL, plus),</li>
            <li>balances and interest rates,</li>
            <li>current repayment plan and payment history.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 2 – Run simulations in the federal loan tool</h3>
          <p>
            Once RAP is built into the official simulator:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>compare at least 3 scenarios: RAP, current IBR/SAVE, and standard 10-year or extended plans,</li>
            <li>capture screenshots or PDFs of results for your records.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 3 – Decide whether you want to opt in or avoid auto-migration</h3>
          <p>
            Policies may include default migration of some borrowers into RAP. Watch for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>servicer emails or letters explaining your options,</li>
            <li>deadlines to opt out or choose a different plan.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 4 – Check PSLF or forgiveness compatibility</h3>
          <p>
            If you are pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) or another forgiveness path:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>make sure RAP counts as a <strong>qualifying plan</strong>,</li>
            <li>verify that switching plans does not reset your progress.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Step 5 – Document everything</h3>
          <p>
            Keep:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>copies of servicer communications,</li>
            <li>plan election confirmations,</li>
            <li>records of payment changes and any disputes.</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Student Loan RAP vs IBR 2026 – Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is RAP definitely replacing IBR and other IDR plans?</h3>
        <p>
          As of late 2025, RAP is a proposed new plan intended to simplify the IDR menu and reduce
          some subsidies. The final regulations will determine which older plans remain open to new
          borrowers and how switching works for existing borrowers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will my loans be automatically moved into RAP?</h3>
        <p>
          Implementation details are still being worked out. It is possible that some borrowers could
          be defaulted into RAP under certain conditions, but there should also be opportunities to
          choose a different plan. Always read servicer notices carefully in 2026.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is RAP always worse than IBR or SAVE?</h3>
        <p>
          No. For some very low-income borrowers with modest debt, RAP could be similar or better.
          The main concern is for middle-income, high-debt borrowers who may see much higher lifetime
          payments if they stay in RAP for decades without an aggressive payoff strategy.
        </p>

          No. It summarizes the direction of policy as reported publicly. Final rules will come from
          official federal regulations. Always rely on Department of Education and servicer updates
          once RAP is formally launched.
